= How to use eConference 4.0 =

This tutorial will show you how to use the eConference tool, according to the role you will play during the requirements workshop.


== Download ==
You can get the latest build of eConference from the [http://code.google.com/p/econference/source/checkout SVN] repository page.

</p>  



== Running the tool ==
After downloading the tool, extract it and double click on the .exe file named econference. If you have problem running it, you can try to run it from the command line:

{{{# econference --dubug --clean}}}



This does the trick with Eclipse, and so it is supposed to do as well for eConference, which is built upon the Eclipse Rich Client Platform.



== Connecting ==
Click on the Plug icon in the top-left corner of the GUI (see Figure  2).



<p align="center">

<br />*Figure 2. The basic GUI*   
</p>


 

When the Login Dialog is displayed (see Figure  3) fill in the fields with the data that you have received. Choose a profile name and this profile will be stored and available when you reconnect.

</p>


To check whether you are connected, see if the light bulb in the bottom-right corner is enabled and move the mouse over it: the tooltip should display all the connection details (see Figure  4).

</p>


Don't panic if you don't see anyone in the roster: you have no buddies, and also you cannot add them to the buddy list, so you won't distract yourselves chatting with online buddies during the elicitation :)





== Joining an eConference event ==
This section will show you how to join an event, such as an elicitation or a negotiation, when you are either the moderator or a simple participant. 



=== The Moderator point of view ===
You are going to role-play the moderator during the session. Thus you should have received an email with a file (.ecx) in attachment. This file is necessary to create the room and invite the other participants. Go to the File > Econference > Load configuration menu (see Figure  5).

Browse and select the .ecx file wherever you saved it. Press Ok and you will see a small dialog which just shows your name and a checkbox that will ensure that the server will send invitations to all the participants registered in the configuration (Figure  6). Be sure to leave it checked, otherwise you will have to invite each of them manually=  =Press ok and you will see the GUI changing and showing the new perspective for the structured conversation.

<br />*Figure  6. Moderator is about to create and join the event*  
</p>




=== The participant point of view ===
If you are a participant, that is not so much to do to join the event: Just be sure to connect and wait until you receive an invitation: it will show up as an item in the Events pane. . It is not a problem if the invitation was sent while you were offline. The server will store it for you and send it as soon as you get connected.

The invitations received will be displayed in this pane, and stored until you delete it. When you select an invitation, the details about the event will be show in the lower part of the Events pane.

To join an eConference event, just double-click on the item or press the button circled in the picture below. 




<p align="center">

<br />*Figure  7. The participant has been invited*  
</p>


Now just click Ok and you will see the GUI change, showing the new perspective for the structured conversation.



== How to participate in an eConference Event ==
This section will briefly show what the views are meant for, and what action each participant can do on them.

Once you have entered the event, you will see the online stakeholders in the Who's on view (see picture below). The blue icon indicates who is the Moderator.




<p align="center">

<br />*Figure  8. Who's on list, showing online stakeholders*   
</p>


=== Selecting the Scribe ===
Before the event starts, the Moderator must grant a participant the Scribe privilege. This is accomplished by right-clicking the stakeholder and select the 'Grant scribe role' item from the popup menu (see figure below).


<p align="center">

<br />

<p align="center">

<br />*Figure  10. Tester 2 is the scribe* 
</p>




It would be good to select the scribe before the conversation takes place. So the moderator should ask the stakeholders who wants to be the scribe. Also note that the scribe can be changed on the fly and that there can be multiple scribe at the same time.



==== What does being a Scribe mean? ====
If you have been selected as a Scribe, then you will see the refresh icon   in the Decisions Place view enabled now. Thus, when the discussion will take place, you will have to sum-up all the decisions that have been taken about each item, as it is being discussed. Thus you will edit an ongoing minute of the event. Be sure to press the refresh icon at every significant update, so that to show what you have written to the other stakeholders.

</p>


=== The Structured Conversation ===
As soon as you enter the event the eConference is still stopped, but you can freely chat with the participants who are currently online while you wait for the others to join. When everyone is online, the moderator decides that it is time to start to work and presses the start button in the Agenda=  =

This view basically shows the list of the items that the stakeholders have to discuss about (see Figure  12). This view is read only for all of the participants. Instead the moderator uses it to:

*Append new item to discuss about

->Clicking on the icon in the right-top corner, a popup is displayed so that the moderator can enter the new item (see Figure  13). All the changes are propagate to all the online participants

*Start / stop the conference

->After pressing the start button, the moderator can select the current item from the list. This means that the discussion must be about the current item only.

<br />
<p align="center">
http://econference4.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/append_q.png 
<br />*Figure  13. Appending a new question*   
</p>
  
As soon as the moderator selects the first item in the Agenda, say Item 1, you will see the talk view tab renamed from 'Free talk' into 'Item 1'. Also, all the previous messages will be hidden, just to show only the newly-entered statements related to the current item (see Figure  14). 




<p align="center">
http://econference4.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/threaded1.png 
<br />*Figure  14. Conversation about "Item 1"*  
</p>

Suppose you have reached a consensus about the current item, and the Scribe has summed up the decisions taken: It is time to move the another item, say Item 2. The Moderator selects it in the agenda. All the statements about Item 1 are hidden, and the talk view is again clean, ready to list only the statements related to Item 2 (see below).



<p align="center">
http://econference4.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/threaded2.png 
<br />*Figure  15. Conversation about "Item 2"*   
</p>


Yeah, but suppose that someone reads what the scribe has written is in the Decisions Place and realizes he/she is not agree? Can we move back??? Sure, you can=== Furthermore, as soon as you move back to an item that has been previously discussed, all the messages already sent will appear in the talk view again= The dashes indicates the beginning of a new session in the conversation about the Item 1 (see Figure  16).  === =


<p align="center">
http://econference4.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/threaded1_1.png 
<br />*Figure  16.  Sessions in the conversation about "Item 1"*  
</p>

The discussion goes on for each single item, until all have been discussed and consensus on them reached. Then the Moderator presses the Stop button and you are back in the free talk view to say Ciao to the stakeholders=  =

=== Hand raising: a social protocol ===
The hand raising feature is not fundamental, but it can be useful if you see that too many stakeholders are talking simultaneously and things are getting a bit messy.

Thus the moderator can press this icon   in the Hand Raising View, and tells the stakeholders to raise hand to start a turn-taking conversation. Thus, as in real life, you raise your hand to ask someone a question or simply asking the right to speak. This is a social protocol however, as you are always allowed to jump in whenever you want. Interrupt people, but do it at your own riskï¿½

Participants request the right to speak by pressing the following icon   in the view. Note that it is disabled until the moderator decides to enable the use of this protocol.

Fill the popup with a brief description of what you want to ask for instance, and press Ok.



<p align="center">

<br />*Figure  17. Asking a question (Participant role)*  
</p>

The questions will appear in the view and the moderator has the power to approve question or reject them right-clicking on each of them (see below). Question approved will show in the Talk view.

The moderator should avoid to reject questions as much as he/she can, or at least should provide a motivation and avoid to frustrate the other stakeholders.

=== Save your logs ===
The event is over. As soon as you try to disconnect, close the perspective or even shut down the application you will be prompted to save both the conversation logs and the Decisions place content (see Figure  19). Each log will be store in a flat text file. Be sure to say yes, as you will need them to complete your project RFP=  =

</p>



== Troubleshooting ==
=== Accidental disconnections ===
==== As a Moderator: ====
If you get accidentally disconnected and you are the moderator, reconnect and load again the .ecx file. If you see someone disappear from the who's on list, be sure to invite him/her again pressing the icon highlighted in the picture below. Then select the id of the missing stakeholders from the drop-down list.

</p>


"NOTE"

Because of a known bug, when you see a participant reconnected after being disconnect, please press again the current item in the agenda, so than the newcomers can synchronize on the current item discussion.





==== As a Participant: ====
Simply reconnect (restart the tool if you want) and double-click on the invitation you received.
