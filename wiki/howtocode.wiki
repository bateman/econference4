= Introduction =

This page lists all the *good practices* _(to respect at any cost)_ and *bad practices* _(to avoid at any cost)_ that must be observed by any developer contributing to the eConference 4 project.


= Details =

=== Dont's ===
  # commit broken files
  # commit untested files
  # commit unformatted files, use Eclipse built-in style
  # commit files with warnings (e.g. unused vars or imports)
  # commit files with non organized imports
  # commit files with {{{//XXX}}}, {{{//TODO}}}, and {{{//FIXME}}} comment annotations
  # commit any resource without a description or changelog in the comment field
  # commit any change without a related JUnit/Jmock (if possible) test case proving it works fine

=== Do's ===
  # report number and link to the issue tracker item when committing a bug fix, or enhancement, or whatever change made in response to an open issue.
  # respect java style code conventions for vars, files, packages, classes, interfaces, methods and so on; see [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html here] for more
  # when a bug is encountered, first open an issue in the issue tracker and describe it; then fix and commit changes
  # write JUnit/JMock (if possible) test cases for new features added
