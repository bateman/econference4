#summary A list of do's and dont's to respect when contributing to eConference and its related projects.
#labels Featured,Howto,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

This page lists all the *good practices* _(to be respected at any cost)_ and *bad practices* _(to be avoided at any cost)_ that must be observed by any developer contributing to the eConference 4 project.

Besides, you may want to follow this [http://eclipse.dzone.com/articles/using-mylyn-with-google-code-u guide] to configure Eclipse to display and manage the issue from the IDE.


= Details =

=== Do's ===
  # report issue description in English (not Italian!)
  # report number and link to the issue tracker item when committing a bug fix, or enhancement, or whatever change made in response to an open issue
  # respect Java coding style and conventions for vars, files, packages, classes, interfaces, methods and so on (see [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html here] for more)
  # when a bug is encountered, first open an issue in the issue tracker and describe it; then fix it and commit changes
  # write JUnit/Mockito (if possible) test cases for new features added (please, read these guides about [HowToWriteJunitTestCases unit] and [HowToWriteMockTestCases mock] testing for more)
  # add the MIT FOSS License prologue when adding new files to the repository. Grab a copy of the MIT License [MitLicense here]

=== Dont's ===
  # add code comments in Italian! Use English, instead.
  # commit broken files
  # commit untested files
  # commit unformatted files, use Eclipse built-in style
  # commit files with warnings (e.g. unused vars or imports)
  # commit files with non organized imports
  # commit files with {{{//XXX}}}, {{{//TODO}}}, and {{{//FIXME}}} comment annotations that do not have a related issue open in the issue tracker
  # commit any resource without a description or changelog in the comment field
  # commit changes without any related JUnit/Jmock test cases (if possible), to prove that everything works fine
