Suppose that we have a class named MathOp that carry out operation of addition and subtraction; suppose that we want write a unit test for this class.

public class MathOp {
    public MathOp() {
    }
 
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
 
    public int sub(int a, int b) {
        return a – b;
    }
}

First, we must create another class that we call, by convention,  
Come accennato prima, è necessario creare un’altra classe, che deve essere chiamata MathOpTest.
To use JUnit library is necessary to add it to the build path of the project. (you can do it adding library from the preference of the Eclipse project).

= Import JUnit class =
To use the constructs of JUnit to do assertion on method's result, it's necessary to import, first of all, the library and import statically the class of package org.junit.Assert:
