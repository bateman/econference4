Turn;Who;Utterance
1;Craig Stuart;who wants to scribe it up?
2;laneb;shotty not it
3;laneb;heh
4;Ryan Nordman;I'll do it
5;Craig Stuart;thanks ryan
6;Odysseus;So you know Ryan, everytime you enter something into the decisions place, you need to hit the refresh. Last time i had to anyhow
7;Odysseus;so everyone can see what you put
8;Ryan Nordman;Oh, ok, thx
9;Ryan Nordman;Do you want to enable hand raising, Craig?
10;beckd;hello?>
11;Craig Stuart;I think we should be ok without the hand raising 
12;Christopher Hanlon;Hi Beckd, could you tell us your full name.
13;Craig Stuart;we can play it by ear though
14;Craig Stuart;is that everyone?
15;Odysseus;our group is all here 
16;beckd;Daniel Beck
17;mcmahonp;yep
18;beckd;your loyal coworker
19;laneb;say I if you're not here
20;mcmahonp;Everyone is here
21;Ryan Nordman;Ok, let's begin
22;Craig Stuart;alright folks, let go
23;sheny;i have some difficulty here...i am just goin off and log in again..so craig can u invite me again when i am bac?thks..
24;Christopher Hanlon ;Developer speeking: We're plan on focussing on the kiosk in RS 3.0 does that sound reasonable to you guys?
25;Price, Tyler;i'd say so
26;Odysseus;sounds fine
27;zhangc;yse
28;Kia Dastmalchian;sounds good
29;Tyler Gates;since the prototype was based on that, I would say it's good
30;laneb;I'd say that sounds right.
31;Michael;Yes
32;Ryan Nordman;I think it's possible we might change our minds though...
33;Michael;I like the spelling of speeking.
34;Price, Tyler;really how?
35;Ryan Nordman;I'm just not sure how much more we can develop the requirements and prototypes for the kiosk, considering how much we've already delved into that
36;Ryan Nordman;We'll need to have some further discussions.
37;Michael;Understandable.
38;Price, Tyler;hmm... so what else would you be doing?
39;Tyler Gates;about rs 3.0?
40;mcmahonp;"Well, I think we are just supposed to make sure 3.0 is ""perfect"", rather then add more content."
41;Ryan Nordman;One possibility might be the on-board bus system for the driver
42;zhangc;well,yes, Michael
43;beckd;I think that was is a bit challenging
44;Ryan Nordman;Yeah, that's a good point Paul
45;beckd;I think that a trip planning feature, going into the different ways it would be accessed through things such as kiosk, web based and pda might be a bit more feasible
46;Craig Stuart;that could also be a bit tough
47;Ryan Nordman;ok,
48;Ryan Nordman; anyway, for now we'll say we're going to focus on the Kiosk.  We'll let you know if we change our minds.
49;mcmahonp;yes
50;Craig Stuart;it's selected on mine.........
51;Michael;Okay, all are items we  would like to see.
52;Kia Dastmalchian;...well whatever component you guys have the most understanding of would probably be best, and its totally up to you
53;Tyler Gates;we still don't have the eval criteria for rs 3.0. don't worry about that today
54;Ryan Nordman;Alright, let's move on
55;laneb;the thing is, if you decide now, you'll get more out of this meeting.
56;laneb;and waste less time in emails later on
57;Craig Stuart;we just want to get a bit of feedback from you guys about the scheduling feature
58;Craig Stuart;and how it would be used by potential riders
59;Price, Tyler;You mean the trip planning? Or just the sked printouts?
60;Ryan Nordman;Just the schedule, not trip planning
61;beckd;one thing that we were thinking was something similar to the current victoria bus schedule that's online
62;beckd;a bus schedule feature would allow users to view the routes of all busses at any time of any day of the week
63;Michael;To view what time a bus will arrive at a paticular stop. Either today or in the future. It should have all other stops on that route listed as well to see at a glance when it may arrive... etc. Similar to Victoria's.
64;beckd;more of an informational thing
65;Craig Stuart;right
66;Price, Tyler;Okay, well the victoria one is fine
67;Price, Tyler; but you sort of need to know what bus you are taking - need search feature
68;Craig Stuart;you mean just searching by bus route number, or by some other parameter?
69;Price, Tyler;so like search by postal code or region of town
70;Price, Tyler;esqimalt, sooke, etc.
71;Price, Tyler;just so you know what busses pass by
72;Tyler Gates;maybe a map
73;Michael;But also route number as if they are avid travellers they will know what bus.
74;beckd;and this would filter all busses that service any of these areas
75;laneb;bus route numbers only mean something to someone who takes those busses all the time
76;Price, Tyler;searching by route name/number may be helpful as well
77;Ryan Nordman;Ok
78;Ryan Nordman;So we'll add search functionality to the schedule lookup interface
79;mcmahonp;well, wouldn't someone only want to view a schedule if they regularly took the bus?  otherwise wouldn't they use trip  planning?
80;Michael;In theory, or if they would like to know how often a given bus comes.
81;Price, Tyler;(the translink schedule is a bit better, you can choose which stops you want t he times of)
82;beckd;I think that paul's point is valid, but I know that even in victoria, there are some buses of which i dont' know the exact routes, it would be beneficial for them I think to be able to find out if other busses can go to points
83;Christopher Hanlon;Testing 123...
84;Bryan Lane;did everyone get booted there or just me?
85;Price, Tyler;not me
86;Odysseus;i didn't get booted
87;beckd;I'm good
88;Craig Stuart;where did Chris go
89;hanlonc;I suddenly stopped getting messages.
90;Odysseus;apparently ppl are being randomly booted
91;Tyler Gates;great
92;beckd;what do you guys think of the option of seeing the routes of a zoomable map, chooseing routes via area of city
93;beckd;or being able ot select route number
94;hanlonc;Has anyone on a Windows computer being booted?
95;zhangc;I am fine here
96;Ryan Nordman;Ok, so maybe 2 different views of the schedule?  Like a view for a single bus route, listing multiple stops and their stop times as well as a view for a single stop, listing multiple busses and their stop times at that one stop?
97;Michael;A feature of this program that the eConference tool like to demonstrate often.
98;Michael;That works with me.
99;Odysseus;i'm fine i think it sounds good 
100;beckd;was that ryan's comment you were replying to?
101;Michael;Indeed it was.
102;Price, Tyler;2 views, and a map, and searching by postal/area/route
103;Bryan Lane;I was trying to mention when I got booted, that maybe if we have the search idea that we can search by a landmark on the route
104;Bryan Lane;so I could say, search for a route that runs by x.
105;Bryan Lane;maybe that's route planning though
106;beckd;that sounds a lot like route planning
107;Craig Stuart;i would say so
108;Bryan Lane;I was just thinking if I couldn't remember the number of the route
109;beckd;that would be the point of hte trip planner
110;Price, Tyler;okay then organize routes by region
111;Ryan Nordman;How does that look? (decisions place)
112;Bryan Lane;I think that works
113;beckd;Maybe address instead of postal code
114;beckd;I don't know much about postal codes except my house
115;Michael;No I think that works Brian.
116;Michael;Route planning when they want the system to plan their route based on a destination vs just asking when a bus comes by a given stop.
117;Ryan Nordman;Alright, shall we move on to the next item?
118;Craig Stuart;alright
119;Craig Stuart;are you guys ready?
120;Tyler Gates;yes
121;Kia Dastmalchian;ok
122;beckd;k
123;zhangc;ok
124;Michael;In addition to the items in the decision place...I would also say search by bus route number.
125;hanlonc;The trip planning system doesn't require you to know the bus number.
126;Ryan Nordman;right
127;Michael;and route name.
128;beckd;definitely
129;Michael;Thanks!
130;Bryan Lane;ok, that's better.
131;Ryan Nordman;great
132;Tyler Gates;name isn't that useful I think
133;Kia Dastmalchian;no, name is very useful
134;Michael;I agree with Kia. :-)
135;Bryan Lane;name is useful
136;Price, Tyler;what number is the Majestic, I don't know
137;Bryan Lane;i'd remember the name before the number
138;Michael;Sorry Tyler.
139;Ryan Nordman;If it isn't useful to a bus rider, they don't have to use it :)
140;sheny;yeha...the name of the bus route can tell where the dest is..
141;Kia Dastmalchian;names of hte routes are easier to remember than numbers, and may mean something to someone who doesn't know the routes
142;Tyler Gates;really?
143;Tyler Gates;ok
144;Craig Stuart;alright guys, I won't move on until everyone finishes typing
145;Craig Stuart;just to keep things organized
146;Tyler Gates;downtown via hillside vs. #4
147;Kia Dastmalchian;if its called downtown via hillside, then I know just from that that that is where it goes
148;Michael;downtown would be useful as it would give all busses that have a dest of downtown.
149;Michael;then it would list all the different via's for an example
150;Tyler Gates;ok so  we do both then?
151;Bryan Lane;yeah, the route name covers my concern, the names are descriptive enough
152;Christopher Hanlon;I'm getting booted whenever discussions are logged.
153;Michael;anyways I think we have agreed to include search by bus name anyway...
154;Ryan Nordman;alright
155;Ryan Nordman;, we're out of time on this topic, let's move on
156;Tyler Gates;yes
157;Craig Stuart;We need to move along to the next topic
158;zhangc;well, yeah, name is useful in this case
159;Bryan Lane;apparently the boot on discussion log is a known bug
160;Odysseus;yea, i think we're good to mvoe on
161;Kia Dastmalchian;we should be able to search by both, as the routes have both name and number
162;Craig Stuart;our next topic is about the Realtime map feature that we presented on Thursday
163;Craig Stuart;we just want to get some more feedback from you about the different ways to view/select/filter locations on this map
164;Tyler Gates;For the view, I think we wanted a zoom feature
165;Ryan Nordman;So basic features include panning around the city map, and zooming in or out
166;Kia Dastmalchian;well, it is important that at a particular kiosk, the map that you see shows the buses that actually pass by the station the kiosk is at, by default
167;Ryan Nordman;Yeah
168;Odysseus;select a region with a square box and it zooms in to that area?
169;Tyler Gates;exactly
170;Ryan Nordman;No, I think we'd want something simpler just like a magnifying glass + or - button
171;Bryan Lane;I like the +/- thing
172;beckd;Currently the filtering will filter any stops around the specific stop that the kiosk is located at.  If the map is zoomed and panned, are you alright that only the routes that intersect a stop will be shown on the realtime map
173;Kia Dastmalchian;I think so,
174;; I'm not sure why you'd want to see other ones
175;Bryan Lane;maybe some kind of overlay with the list of busses shown, that you can toggle on and off?
176;Ryan Nordman;Now, if the users can pan around the whole map, we should probably display all the routes in the city if they want
177;Tyler Gates;if you want to transfer...
178;Michael;The map feature should be available when trip planning as well so the actual route the trip planner has created will be outlined with different line colours or something to mark bus  routes vs walking areas.
179;beckd;That's what I was thinking,
180;beckd; but it makes the filtering a bit messy
181;Ryan Nordman;Yeah, Bryan's idea is a good one,
182;Ryan Nordman; so we could pop up a window with check box style buttons for every bus route, so that a user can add any bus route to the map and see what's up with it
183;Tyler Gates;I like that idea
184;beckd;Bryan, What you suggest is currenly what is going to happen, however it is difficult to list all the busses in the city in this fashion
185;Price, Tyler;or draw a line with your finger and show every route that goes on a street crossign that line
186;zhangc;good idea
187;Price, Tyler;although that isn't very intuitive
188;beckd;Checkboxes with touchscreen might be a bit difficult
189;Craig Stuart;sorry guys.......I got dropped there
190;Michael;uh?
191;Tyler Gates;if it's a popup box, then it could be easy
192;Chris Hanlon;test.
193;Ryan Nordman;I just said check box style buttons
194;Bryan Lane;well it's a touch screen right? 
195;Bryan Lane;couldn't it just be a list of numbers that if you touch it it turns green and shows on screen, and if you touch it again, the number turns red and the busses aren't displayed?
196;Ryan Nordman;I was just trying to describe the functionality of the buttons, obviously we'd want something big enough for a user's finger
197;Ryan Nordman;anyway, shall we move on?
198;beckd;Okay
199;Ryan Nordman;is everybody happy with the decisions?
200;Craig Stuart;alright, on to the next topic
201;Bryan Lane;right. 
202;Bryan Lane;they could be listed down the left side or something.
203;Kia Dastmalchian;"well, the box that pops up could only list the routes that you would see based on what your map sees; like your current level of zoom only has 4 routes passing through, so you could only choose to view those 4"
204;Odysseus;yes check boxes are fine i think
205;Bryan Lane;or even hidden
206;Craig Stuart;we need to move on guys
207;Kia Dastmalchian;hold up
208;Michael;i'm not sure why it needs to be a check box... busses that have a paticular destination or starting point, or pass through a certain region or stop works for me... then it can all be search based instead of covering half the map region with a list...???
209;Ryan Nordman;Yeah, 
210;Ryan Nordman;that's why I'm thinking it would pop up
211;Ryan Nordman;So you wouldn't see the list of routes unless you called it up
212;Ryan Nordman;Then you select the routes, and accept
213;Ryan Nordman;and you see the map again, full screen
214;Bryan Lane;yeah
215;Bryan Lane;, it could be hidden and you pop up the box, select routes, and the box goes away
216;Michael;So you're suggesting that additional filtering can be done ontop of the searching mentioned.
217;Ryan Nordman;because I think there'd be too many routes to list on the side of the screen
218;Michael;That works for me.
219;Kia Dastmalchian;but what routes will it list?
220;Odysseus;basically, you choose what you want to see first right?
221;Ryan Nordman;every route in the city
222;Tyler Gates;by default, it should display every route on the current zoom level
223;Bryan Lane;but the default would be the selected route(s)
224;Michael;Yeah
225;Michael;, you'd search for an area or something... then filter out routes from there?
226;Ryan Nordman;Well, I envision that when they first call up the map it will already have selected the routes that pass by the kiosk's stop
227;Craig Stuart;alright guys, 
228;Craig Stuart;maybe we can talk about this one a bit more later, but our time is limited here
229;Bryan Lane;ryan's thinking what I'm thinking
230;Tyler Gates;ok next
231;Craig Stuart;we have 6 more topics
232;Michael;Yes to landmarks. :-)
233;Price, Tyler;for the landmarks mabye you could make it so the admins add them and create categories for them
234;Ryan Nordman;What extra detail do we need here guys?  
235;;Maybe we can skip this topic for now
236;Price, Tyler;just add by street / postal codes
237;Kia Dastmalchian;I'm thinking 'landmarks' would basically be a set of keywords related to a route, or something like that
238;beckd;What we would like is to decide on the types of landmarks you wanted
239;Michael;street / postal codes and landmark name(s)
240;mcmahonp;we were thinking categories like museums or movie theatres
241;Craig Stuart;restaurants too perhaps
242;beckd;So far we were thinking restaurants, nightlife, parks, shopping centers
243;Kia Dastmalchian;streets, buildings, parks
244;Price, Tyler;yeah but have it so the admins can add more land marks and categories
245;Craig Stuart;sounds good
246;Bryan Lane;you might have a ton of categories like that
247;Kia Dastmalchian;agree with tyler
248;Ryan Nordman;Yeah, what Tyler said
249;Odysseus;well as long as there are categories and such we could add them in ourselves
250;Bryan Lane;it might be better to go by keyword
251;beckd;We wanted to keep the top level landmarks very simple
252;Ryan Nordman;If we do that, we don't need to specify what categories will exist
253;Ryan Nordman;it'll just be up to you
254;beckd;no more than about 6-7 types
255;mcmahonp;you choose what categories you want, and we build the list
256;Ryan Nordman;well, that can be their choice
257;Ryan Nordman;no need to constrain it on our end
258;Price, Tyler;well if you let the admins choose the categoreis it would be up to them, not the developers
259;Ryan Nordman;agreed
260;Craig Stuart;right
261;Michael;good
262;Craig Stuart;alright
263;Craig Stuart;, moving on?
264;Kia Dastmalchian;ok
265;Bryan Lane;ok
266;Odysseus;sounds good to me
267;Craig Stuart;next topic is the access to the system from mobile devices such as PDA's and cellphones
268;Price, Tyler;i was thinking just a separate style sheet for the website ...
269;Ryan Nordman;Is it alright if we simply provide a scalled down mini version of the webpage?
270;Tyler Gates;yeah
271;Odysseus;yea
272;Kia Dastmalchian;I think so
273;Bryan Lane;that's what I was thinking yeah
274;Ryan Nordman;Yeah, so that all the same functionality of the website will be there, it'll just be setup for a smaller screen
275;Odysseus;probably as light on graphics as possible?
276;Bryan Lane;right... 
277;Bryan Lane;do we need the map?
278;Bryan Lane; it might be handy but would be hell on portable devices
279;zhangc;yes, that is good
280;Michael;And touch areas would need to be numbered or something. I'm not sure how PDA's work.
281;Tyler Gates;I think a map would be necessary
282;Michael;Map necessary.
283;Ryan Nordman;It should be possible to do the map
284;Odysseus;yes it is needed
285;Craig Stuart;it wouldn't really work on a cellphone or any device without a touch screen
286;Ryan Nordman;they'll just need to zoom more
287;Michael;Indeed.
288;Price, Tyler;I think he meant clickable not touchable
289;Price, Tyler;I've never used the web on a phone so...
290;Bryan Lane;well the cellphone you could use buttons to move a cursor around
291;Craig Stuart;alright
292;beckd;k 
293;beckd;I think we're good?
294;Ryan Nordman;Next topic?
295;Craig Stuart;moving on
296;Michael;yes
297;Craig Stuart;next topic is the aspects of the on-board bus system
298;Ryan Nordman;You said that you wanted the bus drivers to be able to see their own schedule
299;Ryan Nordman;How many stops in advance do you want displayed?
300;Kia Dastmalchian;umm
301;Michael;For the decision place I would like to see search added to realtime map part.
302;Ryan Nordman;I think we're considering a small screen, perhaps even just a digital one line text display
303;Price, Tyler;so just the next stop?...
304;Ryan Nordman;Michael - what kind of search?
305;Bryan Lane;one line?
306;Bryan Lane;like scrolling text?
307;Bryan Lane;i don't think that would work
308;Kia Dastmalchian;by 'own schedule', it means their actual, hard, schedule, not a dynamically changing thing...at least that's how I understand it
309;Ryan Nordman;Yes, it could scroll
310;Bryan Lane;well, that'd be hard to read while driving
311;Bryan Lane;don't you think?
312;Odysseus;yea one line is insufficient i think
313;Tyler Gates;no scrolling. it would distract the driver
314;Price, Tyler;maybe a small lcd that has like the next stop big and then acouple more underneath
315;Ryan Nordman;Yes
316;Ryan Nordman;, I would think they'd just read it when they're at a stop
317;Kia Dastmalchian;ok hold on a sec
318;Kia Dastmalchian;a driver doesn't need to know his next stop one after the other
319;Michael;I would have atleast 3 or so, except when near end of route... then it would have arrival time at last stop, and departure time.
320;Price, Tyler;he needs to know if is behind or ahead of sched
321;Kia Dastmalchian;he can read the router or whatever before he drives, what the onscreen can provide is a copy of this for his reference
322;Kia Dastmalchian;he does not need to view it while driving
323;Price, Tyler;no there is like time checkpoints so he doesn't go too fast
324;Bryan Lane;yeah, it's more for whether he's on time or getting behind/ahead
325;Michael;He'd more likely look at it when stopping to pick up people.
326;Kia Dastmalchian;as for seeing stuff on screen, its like bryan just said here
327;Michael;yep
328;Price, Tyler;I would say on the screen the next few stops and if connecting buses are running late
329;Tyler Gates;the driver would need to know HOW late he is
330;Price, Tyler;as an option
331;Bryan Lane;I still think that a scrolling text line would force you to look at the screen for a fixed amount of time
332;Michael;I agree with Brian's point.
333;Ryan Nordman;ok, so I'm hearing that multi-line display would be best
334;Michael;Yes.
335;Odysseus;yea
336;Tyler Gates;yes
337;beckd;How about at the top it says you are running this late or are this ahead, and then a time for the next two stops
338;Kia Dastmalchian;what about instead of scrolling, it just flashes different lines, so you don't have to stare at it…
339;Kia Dastmalchian;do you know what I mean?
340;Michael;Sure.
341;Michael; It doesn't really need to state whether the driver is late or ahead. They should not be ahead with this display as there would be time checkpoint. People expect the bus not to come too early.
342;Bryan Lane;you'd still have to watch for the line you're looking for
343;Ryan Nordman;Do you want the bus driver to advance the stop display manually?
344;Ryan Nordman;for his schedule?
345;Craig Stuart;i don't think there is any need to do it manually....
346;Michael;No, it should be automatic. No input required from driver while on route.
347;Ryan Nordman;Because the other option is to tie it in with GPS and have it show the stops based on where the bus is
348;Craig Stuart;yeah
349;Michael;Yes to Ryan's comment.
350;Bryan Lane;I like that too
351;beckd;I Think that would be pretty resonable ryan, as everything is already tied in
352;Craig Stuart;alright......moving to next topic
353;Ryan Nordman;ok
354;beckd;soudns good
355;Craig Stuart;next topic is regarding connections between routes
356;Price, Tyler;whoa, does the display say anything about late connecting bus es?
357;Ryan Nordman;I'd also like to discuss the onboard bus display for the connection data as well
358;Craig Stuart;alright........our time is pretty limited, we have 5 minutes left
359;Bryan Lane;well, we can cover the late connecting busses in this section, since it's pertinent
360;Ryan Nordman;I think we could just use the same display, but have two buttons to allow the bus driver to select what to view
361;Ryan Nordman;perhaps with a sound alert when connecting data is coming in?
362;Price, Tyler;I would say that each trip has about 10 minutes of play, so at important connection stopes (hubs, terminals) drivers will wait up to like 3 minutes for connecting buses...
363;Tyler Gates;maybe if there is another bus within a certain proximity, it would display it
364;Chris Hanlon;Could we send an auditory alert (such as a beep) to encourage the bus driver to look at the console for information about late busses/route changes.
365;beckd;if every bus driver is willing to wait 3 minutes 
366;beckd;then a bus that is subsequently connecting to it would have to wait at least 3 minutes 1 second to connect to it
367;Michael;I don't know if an audiable alert is necessary.
368;mcmahonp;Wait a bus driver will wait 3 minutes at a stop - won't that really mess up the system
369;beckd;it would lead to a pushing back of times
370;Tyler Gates;if they're already late, then it would make them later
371;Price, Tyler;If they are already late they wouldn't need to wait
372;Bryan Lane;that's kind of why I figured it would be a good thing to let the driver know how far behind the bus is, so he could just make an informed decision
373;Craig Stuart;that pushing back of times would mess up people who had checked the schedule an hour before
374;beckd;Well the instand that they are waiting 3 minutes, they are late
375;Michael;I wouldn't expect the bus driver to wait more than 30 seconds. But if the system will display busses up to 3 minutes late allowing the bus driver to choose.
376;Bryan Lane;if it's 5 seconds behind (ie around the corner), he could just wait. if it's 5 minutes, don't bother.
377;Ryan Nordman;Yeah,
378;Ryan Nordman;my thinking is that the whole system would work best if we rely on the driver's judgement on whether to wait for a connecting bus
379;Kia Dastmalchian;does the system even know when a bus is late? I'm confused about this
380;sheny;so the onboard system won't remind the driver to wait if he is already late?
381;Ryan Nordman;we can inform them of how late the connecting bus is and let them decide
382;Bryan Lane;yeah, it's supposed to kia
383;Kia Dastmalchian;I thought this would show the location of the connecting bus, as in if it just plain isn't there
384;Odysseus;Yea, it should be more bus driver decision based
385;Odysseus;their judgement whether to wait or not
386;Kia Dastmalchian;yeah
387;Odysseus;and 3 minutes is too long to wait
388;Craig Stuart;for sure
389;Price, Tyler;say you're on a bus that goes from UVic to Western Exchange and it is suppose to meet a bus that goes from West Ex to Wishart - but the UVic bus is little late, the Wishart driver could aford to wait 3min.
390;Michael;The driver will check the screen when leaving important/connecting stops, no annoying beeps necessary or other notifications. Just additional information to make smart decisions.
391;Bryan Lane;yeah,
392;Bryan Lane;and if you're ahead, you can afford to wait longer
393;Tyler Gates;rural bus routes are different
394;Craig Stuart;i think some sort of audio notification would be beneficial
395;Ryan Nordman;ok, so when should the system display the information to the bus driver?
396;Ryan Nordman;if they should be able to check it at the stop BEFORE the connection, then we need to get that data to the onboard bus system in advance
397;Michael;It will always be there for upcoming stops as soon as it is available. 
398;Ryan Nordman;alright, so maybe if the bus driver pushes a button on their display
399;Ryan Nordman;it will show them how late the connecting bus is running to the next connecting stop?
400;Michael;If they are already on that screen, then nothing needs to be pressed.
401;Ryan Nordman;Michael - yes
402;Bryan Lane;I like being able to manually toggle betweent he screens
403;Michael;If they switched back to the schedule screen, then they'd need to press the other button.
404;Chris Hanlon;I would prefer that the drive not need to press any buttons on the display.
405;Craig Stuart;i agree with Chris
406;beckd;how about showing two seperate screens
407;beckd;one on the left/one on the right
408;beckd;the driver could glance at whichever they wish
409;beckd;so it's easier for the driver to see pertinent information
410;Bryan Lane;2 screens is an alternative
411;Price, Tyler;I've seen our divers press buttons before, they can do it
412;Chris Hanlon;Why do we need 2 screens?
413;Ryan Nordman;That will make the display more expensive
414;Ryan Nordman;, it's up to you guys as clients
415;Ryan Nordman;I don't really feel it's necessary
416;Kia Dastmalchian;I think the 2 screens switching sounds good
417;Tyler Gates;yeah, for simplicity
418;Craig Stuart;why not just break the single screen into a number of frames?
419;Ryan Nordman;Taxi drivers almost have a full keyboard in their cars, I'm sure bus drivers can cope with two buttons
420;Bryan Lane;I don't think the dual screen is necessary
421;Bryan Lane;, but the button to toggle the displayed info is fine
422;Bryan Lane;that's my vote.
423;Michael;I have faith in our bus drivers. Indeed the need to switch could be eliminated as a necessity and there just as an option if on the top of the late bus screen would be the time the driver should leave the next stop.
424;beckd;I think that crowding a display makes the data difficult to easily comprehend
425;Kia Dastmalchian;its not like they should need to switch all that  often, in some kind of panic while they drive
426;zhangc;too much information for drivers, 2 screen is not usefull
427;Bryan Lane;ok so toggle then?
428;Price, Tyler;yeah one screen toggling displays probably best
429;Odysseus;toggle is good
430;Tyler Gates;+1 for toggling
431;Ryan Nordman;ok
432;Bryan Lane;go go toggle
433;Craig Stuart;alright, if that's waht you guys want
434;Price, Tyler;it's what we require
435;Craig Stuart;moving along
436;Michael;Yes, but I liked my suggestion for having the time the driver should leave the next stop, and the current time at the top of the late bus screen as well.
437;Michael;That would reduce always toggling.
438;Bryan Lane;yeah, the first line could be the same on both displays
439;beckd;toggling could be a hassle that drivers just avoid
440;Michael;Sure.
441;beckd;sounds great guys
442;Michael;:-)
443;Michael;>-|
444;Craig Stuart;alright
445;;, so moving along
446;Price, Tyler;(a side: what we these needed for just analysis?)
447;Craig Stuart;next we'd like to ask how you would like the exiting passenger statistics to be recorded
448;beckd;If the system is allowing data to be recorded on who is boarding the bus
449;beckd;why is it important to have exiting stats as well
450;Chris Hanlon;I assume the bus companies want to know which stops people exit at.  Is that correct.
451;Chris Hanlon;?
452;Price, Tyler;exiting stats will allows to know how many people are on the bus at one time during certain parts of the route.
453;Craig Stuart;I think that was the idea
454;mcmahonp;How will we collect these stats?
455;mcmahonp;Do you have the hardware?
456;Michael;Exiting is important to allow bus planners to know which stops are used and which are not. So statistics around what is required would be the stop they departed at, time they departed, route and an estimate.... if number of people is too hard to track, just the knowledge that someone did get off at that stop.
457;Craig Stuart;I believe the original idea was that the driver would enter the numbers into his/her display
458;Price, Tyler;I don't believe we have the hardware
459;mcmahonp;How is a bus driver going to count people getting off?
460;Kia Dastmalchian;that is difficult on the drivers
461;Price, Tyler;I don't think bus drivers can do it
462;Michael;My Proposal:  Busses have infared beams across entraces that simply report when beam interruopted.
463;Price, Tyler;Bus drivers could count oncoming but not exciting
464;Tyler Gates;additional tasks for the bus drivers is always bad
465;Bryan Lane;so when a crowd of people get off the bus at UVIC, a driver is supposed to count as they pile off? 
466;Bryan Lane;that won't work. there's no way.
467;mcmahonp;Same problem with infared
468;mcmahonp;it won't count a group
469;Craig Stuart;yeah
470;mcmahonp;or if someone is leaning against it, it won't count anyone
471;Tyler Gates;we need to hire some guy to stand there and cound people
472;Chris Hanlon;Would infared approximations be acceptable.
473;Michael;I would not have the drivers count it. It's too much to deal with during boarding time....
474;Michael;Infared are near enough the door no one would lean on them.
475;Price, Tyler;what about weight sensors on the wheels, then divide by the average weight per person
476;Ryan Nordman;To be honest, I think hiring a guy might be your best and most cost-effective solution...
477;Price, Tyler;yes I was dan
478;beckd;k good
479;Kia Dastmalchian;thats what we do now, hire a guy
480;Michael;Thanks ryan!
481;Ryan Nordman;assuming you don't need that data constantly
482;Michael;Are you volunteering?
483;beckd;hahaah
484;Tyler Gates;for free
485;Bryan Lane;heheh
486;Ryan Nordman;lol, thanks, but I have a job developing bus tracking systems
487;Michael;Put 1/5 0 of you on each bus?
488;beckd;it looks great on the resume
489;Kia Dastmalchian;we were hoping the system would provide us data from every day instead of once every so often
490;Michael;Yes.
491;Bryan Lane;I'm not seeing the ryan counting in the decision pane
492;Ryan Nordman;Yeah, I can't change the decision place anymore
493;Ryan Nordman;it just boots me
494;mcmahonp;for people getting on we can easily count people via counting fares -- I still don't see any easy way of counting exits
495;Michael;Try making me a scribe too and I'll refresh it for Ryan. It's just a blank screen right ryan?
496;Ryan Nordman;I'll email you a decision summary at the end
497;beckd;So, decision? we won't have exit stats
498;Ryan Nordman;yes, it's blank
499;beckd;except by hiring people
500;Odysseus;i think yea, through the swiping of a card, or insert of money etc, is the best way
501;Odysseus;there isn't really an accurate
502;Odysseus;way to do this...
503;beckd;Okay
504;Tyler Gates;make people swipe a card to get off
505;beckd;moving right along?
506;Kia Dastmalchian;(we could ditch exit stats?)
507;Kia Dastmalchian;where people get on is more important data
508;Bryan Lane;yeah, we do have the stats that the bus would be stopping
509;Craig Stuart;sound good to everyone?
510;beckd;sounds great
511;Tyler Gates;ok
512;Price, Tyler;we could just do estimates how how many people leave best on how many people are allowed one
513;Price, Tyler;on*
514;sheny;we can only knw how many ppl get on the bus in total in a day..but counting ppl get off is pretty hard to achieve i think..
515;Michael;No ditching of exit stats.
516;zhangc;kia is right
517;Michael;Stats as basic as if someone did get off at a stop would be fine.
518;Kia Dastmalchian;michael, you're fired
519;Tyler Gates;have some guy counting people, but not on the bus but at the bus stop
520;Michael;Then stops that no one gets off at would be recorded.
521;Craig Stuart;alright, we can discuss this one more later on
522;Tyler Gates;neeeeeeeeeeext
523;Craig Stuart;i think we should move on to the last topic
524;Chris Hanlon;Would it be appropriate to record how long the doors are open at each stop?  This won't give you an exact number of people getting off the bus but it should help you determine how popular a given stop is?
525;Kia Dastmalchian;thats a good idea
526;Kia Dastmalchian;, depends on how costly it is to implement
527;beckd;k last?
528;Bryan Lane;I dunno CH. elderly/disabled people will throw that off a lot
529;Tyler Gates;old lady = lots of people
530;Price, Tyler;that same hardware could apply to my weight sensor, lol
531;Michael;Sure, door open approximation works fine.
532;Bryan Lane;I guess it's better than nothing though
533;Michael;Well, they've lived as long as many people... they can have the bennifit of being many people.
534;Bryan Lane;haha
535;Craig Stuart;alright, last topic guys
536;Kia Dastmalchian;ok
537;Ryan Nordman;Why don't we send you an email regarding this topc?
538;Ryan Nordman;so we can wrap up now
539;Ryan Nordman;we're already over time
540;Bryan Lane;define -no- english. as in literally none/
541;beckd;second
542;Bryan Lane;?
543;beckd;yes
544;beckd;no english
545;Michael;Use icons for buttons to make the knowledge of enligh a non-necessity to use kiosks.
546;Bryan Lane;well, i think we were just talking using simple words
547;Bryan Lane;as opposed to supporting hundreds of languages
548;Bryan Lane;and what mike said
549;Odysseus;with mike on that one
550;Tyler Gates;a picuture is worth a thousand words
551;Bryan Lane;where possible, anyway
552;beckd;with the landmarks feature though
553;Craig Stuart;that would only work for some of the more  simple functionalilty though
554;Kia Dastmalchian;I don't see a huge language need here either, what they said
555;Michael;English and french a must in a billingual country though...
556;beckd;admins would have to draw pictures representing categories
557;Michael;With option of adding more language at future date.
558;Price, Tyler;only need french for federal stuff
559;Tyler Gates;french, only in quebec
560;Bryan Lane;oh yeah... the french.
561;Tyler Gates;lets just assume that they separated
562;Michael;I propose that the developers come up with some icons that they believe represent our system and run them past us in the next prototype.
563;Michael;:D
564;Bryan Lane;ok. if I have to speak french there, they have to speak english here
565;beckd;okay
566;beckd;i think we're good for now guys
567;Tyler Gates;ok
568;Craig Stuart;alright, that's it folks
569;Michael;Well it so happens that our city is the capitol of the country....
570;Michael;:-) alright.
571;Bryan Lane;wow! promoted!
572;Price, Tyler;logout
573;Kia Dastmalchian;conference...started?
574;beckd;g'day
575;Tyler Gates;/quit
