<utterance turn="305" who="corbettj">be like an ATM that allows you to query patient location etc.. :P</utterance>
<utterance turn="295" who="rizwanp">whoa whoa</utterance>
<utterance turn="296" who="reynens">haha</utterance>
<utterance turn="297" who="rizwanp">what's this about consent and dissent?</utterance>
<utterance turn="298" who="saroyam">like a self-help computer</utterance>
<utterance turn="299" who="nguyenh">maybe direction to a room</utterance>
<utterance turn="300" who="rizwanp">so speaking of PCs in hospital</utterance>
<utterance turn="301" who="nguyenh">or find a parking lot</utterance>
<utterance turn="302" who="rizwanp">ok let's be serious</utterance>
<utterance turn="303" who="reynens">we are?</utterance>
<utterance turn="304" who="reynens">consent was something in the rfp i thought Riz</utterance>
<utterance turn="306" who="rizwanp">michael</utterance>
<utterance turn="307" who="chiuo">you called them info booths or something in the rfp i believe</utterance>
<utterance turn="309" who="reynens">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="308" who="rizwanp">repeat the question again clearly plz</utterance>
<utterance turn="310" who="rizwanp">i don't wanna scroll up</utterance>
<utterance turn="311" who="rizwanp">instead i'll make  a request by typing 3 lines</utterance>
<utterance turn="312" who="rizwanp">including that one</utterance>
<utterance turn="313" who="Michael Clark">So terminals are devices that you would like us to design and add to the system that allow visitors to locate patients and  get other information about the hospital. But before a patient will show up on the terminal search they will have to consent? Correct?</utterance>
<utterance turn="314" who="gosselinc">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="315" who="saroyam">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="316" who="chiuo">hospital map?</utterance>
<utterance turn="317" who="rizwanp">ok ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="318" who="Michael Clark">Okay. Map = excellent idea.</utterance>
<utterance turn="319" who="gosselinc">may i add something really quick?</utterance>
<utterance turn="320" who="kaspara">Yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="321" who="rizwanp">but</utterance>
<utterance turn="322" who="Michael Clark">Of course.</utterance>
<utterance turn="323" who="nguyenh">driving direction as wll</utterance>
<utterance turn="324" who="corbettj">yeah when a patient checks into the hospital they should be given an option to allow people to look up there info</utterance>
<utterance turn="325" who="reynens">yes, a patient must consent to public access (everyone else has access though, Doctors, Admin, Security)</utterance>
<utterance turn="326" who="Michael Clark">Yes.</utterance>
<utterance turn="327" who="rizwanp">driving direction to what?</utterance>
<utterance turn="328" who="gosselinc">ok even without consent the employees of the hospital still have access to the data</utterance>
<utterance turn="330" who="gosselinc">just not the general public</utterance>
<utterance turn="329" who="reynens">*not must, can</utterance>
<utterance turn="331" who="rizwanp">how about a link to google maps instead?</utterance>
<utterance turn="332" who="corbettj">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="333" who="corbettj">hehehehe</utterance>
<utterance turn="334" who="reynens">Now who isn't being serious</utterance>
<utterance turn="335" who="rizwanp">i'm bein serious</utterance>
<utterance turn="336" who="rizwanp">we're on a budget here</utterance>
<utterance turn="337" who="reynens">Google maps is bugged</utterance>
<utterance turn="338" who="reynens">moving on ;)</utterance>
<utterance turn="339" who="nguyenh">may be to check email briefly</utterance>
<utterance turn="340" who="Michael Clark">A google map might not give an accurate floor plan... or one at all. I would suggest something else.</utterance>
<utterance turn="341" who="saroyam">i think a map of the hospital should be enough</utterance>
<utterance turn="342" who="rizwanp">do we want them to build a map software?</utterance>
<utterance turn="343" who="corbettj">&lt;3 yahoo maps :P</utterance>
<utterance turn="344" who="rizwanp">ok someone said driving directions</utterance>
<utterance turn="345" who="reynens">Riz, riz, we can't give them design instructions, just requirements</utterance>
<utterance turn="346" who="rizwanp">so i was talkin bout that</utterance>
<utterance turn="347" who="saroyam">people can find their own way to the hospital</utterance>
<utterance turn="348" who="Michael Clark">Google Earth would give an excellent shot of the roof if that is what you're after.</utterance>
<utterance turn="349" who="reynens">ooooh</utterance>
<utterance turn="350" who="nguyenh">no, but must have a3d floor plan of all the building</utterance>
<utterance turn="351" who="rizwanp">that's not design instructions</utterance>
<utterance turn="352" who="reynens">right, on our external website**</utterance>
<utterance turn="354" who="corbettj">lol google earth</utterance>
<utterance turn="353" who="rizwanp">do we want to include driving directions?</utterance>
<utterance turn="355" who="rizwanp">i don't think so</utterance>
<utterance turn="356" who="saroyam">i dont think so either</utterance>
<utterance turn="357" who="saroyam">just a map of the hospital</utterance>
<utterance turn="358" who="rizwanp">it's too much work</utterance>
<utterance turn="359" who="rizwanp">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="360" who="rizwanp">map is good</utterance>
<utterance turn="361" who="saroyam">u are here. heres how u get to that place</utterance>
<utterance turn="362" who="reynens">no, ... lets say an ADDRESS to the hospital is currently part of the system</utterance>
<utterance turn="363" who="corbettj">ppl can take a cab to the hospital if they can't find it :P</utterance>
<utterance turn="364" who="nguyenh">So they should be able to access the internet abit then</utterance>
<utterance turn="365" who="rizwanp">u think reyens?</utterance>
<utterance turn="366" who="chiuo">I guess general hospital information is good too?</utterance>
<utterance turn="367" who="Michael Clark">I was still trying to focus on these terminals which are located inside of the hospital. That said... it would be my understanding that there is no need for a map of the location of the hospital on the terminals, but perhaps floor plans would be a better idea.</utterance>
<utterance turn="368" who="kaspara">YES</utterance>
<utterance turn="369" who="nguyenh">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="370" who="Michael Clark">Next!</utterance>
<utterance turn="371" who="Michael Clark">Q9. What are the other duties mentioned in project objectives health care staff perform that the new system should aid them with?</utterance>
<utterance turn="372" who="rizwanp">what line, ?</utterance>
<utterance turn="373" who="reynens">i think i know it</utterance>
<utterance turn="374" who="reynens">its not that it aids them with the duties</utterance>
<utterance turn="375" who="reynens">but aids them, while they are doing other things</utterance>
<utterance turn="376" who="saroyam">i think that meant that the self help desk will prevent distraction so that the nurses etc can do other work like handing out meds</utterance>
<utterance turn="377" who="nguyenh">such as operations, cleaning ...</utterance>
<utterance turn="378" who="Michael Clark">Okay. Disregard question.</utterance>
<utterance turn="379" who="rizwanp">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="380" who="Michael Clark">Thanks for the clarification.</utterance>
<utterance turn="381" who="nguyenh">the system doesn't need to assist that</utterance>
<utterance turn="382" who="Michael Clark">Q10. What information will each employee use to login to the system? Is a key card a consideration?</utterance>
<utterance turn="383" who="corbettj">yeah....should automate some of their tasks to free them to do other things</utterance>
<utterance turn="384" who="rizwanp">sure</utterance>
<utterance turn="385" who="gosselinc">finger id!</utterance>
<utterance turn="386" who="rizwanp">retina scan</utterance>
<utterance turn="387" who="corbettj">biometrics hehehe</utterance>
<utterance turn="388" who="nguyenh">sure</utterance>
<utterance turn="389" who="rizwanp">maybe DNA extraction and verifications</utterance>
<utterance turn="390" who="reynens">plas-ma!</utterance>
<utterance turn="391" who="saroyam">user name and password maybe</utterance>
<utterance turn="392" who="rizwanp">bah</utterance>
<utterance turn="393" who="nguyenh">I think we are using the key card for door access</utterance>
<utterance turn="396" who="nguyenh">so we should stick with it</utterance>
<utterance turn="394" who="rizwanp">ur old fashioned</utterance>
<utterance turn="395" who="saroyam">:p</utterance>
<utterance turn="397" who="saroyam">k</utterance>
<utterance turn="398" who="reynens">hold up i have a connected question</utterance>
<utterance turn="399" who="gosselinc">i say key card</utterance>
<utterance turn="400" who="Michael Clark">Are you presently using a keycard for door access?</utterance>
<utterance turn="401" who="rizwanp">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="402" who="nguyenh">Yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="403" who="rizwanp">we are</utterance>
<utterance turn="404" who="saroyam">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="405" who="reynens">.... yes?</utterance>
<utterance turn="406" who="saroyam">lets go with key card</utterance>
<utterance turn="407" who="rizwanp">so same key card?</utterance>
<utterance turn="408" who="Michael Clark">Okay. Good to know.</utterance>
<utterance turn="410" who="reynens">sure</utterance>
<utterance turn="411" who="gosselinc">same keycard</utterance>
<utterance turn="409" who="rizwanp">but but</utterance>
<utterance turn="412" who="rizwanp">it should also allow password access</utterance>
<utterance turn="413" who="nguyenh">same</utterance>
<utterance turn="414" who="fairheadj">yea both</utterance>
<utterance turn="415" who="reynens">swipe a card, enter the password</utterance>
<utterance turn="416" who="nguyenh">ket card came with code</utterance>
<utterance turn="417" who="rizwanp">no</utterance>
<utterance turn="418" who="saroyam">but the help desks dont need a password</utterance>
<utterance turn="419" who="reynens">then inject dna</utterance>
<utterance turn="420" who="fairheadj">either one</utterance>
<utterance turn="421" who="rizwanp">it should allow password access</utterance>
<utterance turn="422" who="chiuo">enter password on what?</utterance>
<utterance turn="423" who="Michael Clark">Our thought with a keycard is that they could use it to prevent entering a username, then require a password in addition.</utterance>
<utterance turn="424" who="reynens">oooh</utterance>
<utterance turn="426" who="reynens">i get you</utterance>
<utterance turn="425" who="chiuo">like a pin?</utterance>
<utterance turn="427" who="nguyenh">should use that code for accessing if can't find the card</utterance>
<utterance turn="428" who="rizwanp">yeah that's good</utterance>
<utterance turn="429" who="rizwanp">do it</utterance>
<utterance turn="430" who="reynens">swipe your card OR enter a password</utterance>
<utterance turn="433" who="nguyenh">that is right</utterance>
<utterance turn="434" who="Michael Clark">I envisioned both.</utterance>
<utterance turn="431" who="rizwanp">but</utterance>
<utterance turn="432" who="rizwanp">if a card goes bad</utterance>
<utterance turn="435" who="rizwanp">then waht?</utterance>
<utterance turn="436" who="reynens">no more buts there Riz</utterance>
<utterance turn="437" who="saroyam">if a card goes bad they can get it fixed</utterance>
<utterance turn="438" who="rizwanp">ok u and me outside rite now</utterance>
<utterance turn="439" who="rizwanp">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="440" who="rizwanp">but that would take a long time</utterance>
<utterance turn="441" who="reynens">Staff can swipe their card, or enter an access password to get at the system.</utterance>
<utterance turn="442" who="fairheadj">yup</utterance>
<utterance turn="443" who="corbettj">sounds good</utterance>
<utterance turn="444" who="nguyenh">so us ethe password instead</utterance>
<utterance turn="445" who="chiuo">so the swipe and username/password on the same panel? is that the plan?</utterance>
<utterance turn="446" who="Michael Clark">Okay, so how about a keycard, and password. But if that fails they have some other username that they can use.</utterance>
<utterance turn="447" who="reynens">no</utterance>
<utterance turn="448" who="rizwanp">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="449" who="rizwanp">good deal</utterance>
<utterance turn="450" who="saroyam">well they need their card to get into certain parts of the building anyways</utterance>
<utterance turn="451" who="reynens">they're screwed and must ask IT</utterance>
<utterance turn="452" who="kaspara">This is kind of just a design thing.</utterance>
<utterance turn="453" who="saroyam">they need their key card for everything not just the system</utterance>
<utterance turn="454" who="Michael Clark">Good point.</utterance>
<utterance turn="455" who="rizwanp">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="456" who="rizwanp">everything?</utterance>
<utterance turn="457" who="kaspara">Our requirment is just a security sytem</utterance>
<utterance turn="458" who="Michael Clark">So keycard and password for system access.</utterance>
<utterance turn="459" who="nguyenh">yep</utterance>
<utterance turn="460" who="corbettj">that's fine</utterance>
<utterance turn="461" who="saroyam">yeah like getting into the medicine cabinets and stuff</utterance>
<utterance turn="462" who="reynens">good point kaspara</utterance>
<utterance turn="463" who="Michael Clark">Okay, we will consider options.</utterance>
<utterance turn="464" who="corbettj">lol</utterance>
<utterance turn="466" who="rizwanp">ok so somebody put the decision up so i know</utterance>
<utterance turn="467" who="rizwanp">what we decided jus now</utterance>
<utterance turn="465" who="Michael Clark">Q11. How will web users be authorized to access patient information on the hospital website?</utterance>
<utterance turn="468" who="Michael Clark">Or will there be no infromation they can access.</utterance>
<utterance turn="469" who="nguyenh">patient should get their invoce</utterance>
<utterance turn="470" who="nguyenh">precriptions</utterance>
<utterance turn="471" who="reynens">ok ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="473" who="Michael Clark">What's a preciption?</utterance>
<utterance turn="474" who="reynens">the website has the SAME information as the Terminals</utterance>
<utterance turn="475" who="rizwanp">what invoice?</utterance>
<utterance turn="472" who="corbettj">go to the site, search for the person your</utterance>
<utterance turn="476" who="corbettj">*you're looking for....their info comes up</utterance>
<utterance turn="477" who="reynens">but, does it have more?</utterance>
<utterance turn="478" who="nguyenh">for the money they own the hospital</utterance>
<utterance turn="479" who="rizwanp">wait</utterance>
<utterance turn="480" who="Michael Clark">Okay. So there is no information that a family member should be able to access about a patient that the whole words cannot access.</utterance>
<utterance turn="481" who="rizwanp">inwe want ppl to access the patients while they are in the hospital</utterance>
<utterance turn="483" who="rizwanp">not after...</utterance>
<utterance turn="482" who="nguyenh">if they have the patient access code</utterance>
<utterance turn="484" who="nguyenh">family member should be able to access</utterance>
<utterance turn="485" who="rizwanp">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="486" who="saroyam">they dont need to know what type of meds the patents are on</utterance>
<utterance turn="487" who="reynens">so all patients will get a username and password?</utterance>
<utterance turn="488" who="saroyam">just what room number and floor they are on</utterance>
<utterance turn="489" who="rizwanp">no</utterance>
<utterance turn="490" who="Michael Clark">First I ask what they will need to provide to get access... then I'll ask what they have access to.</utterance>
<utterance turn="491" who="saroyam">no</utterance>
<utterance turn="492" who="nguyenh">they have acccess card as well</utterance>
<utterance turn="494" who="nguyenh">as they are now</utterance>
<utterance turn="493" who="corbettj">the public can't access patient medical records etc....outside access is limited to visitation type info</utterance>
<utterance turn="500" who="corbettj">that should be available to anyone that wants to visit</utterance>
<utterance turn="495" who="rizwanp">exactly</utterance>
<utterance turn="496" who="reynens">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="497" who="rizwanp">it's the kind of info help desk would provide</utterance>
<utterance turn="498" who="reynens">i'm gonna restate again</utterance>
<utterance turn="499" who="Michael Clark">okay. is that the decision.</utterance>
<utterance turn="501" who="rizwanp">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="502" who="saroyam">sure</utterance>
<utterance turn="503" who="reynens">The information that the TERMINALS provide, floor and room and name</utterance>
<utterance turn="505" who="reynens">will be on the WEBsite</utterance>
<utterance turn="504" who="rizwanp">so it should be up to us what info we wanna put on there</utterance>
<utterance turn="506" who="chiuo">Visiting info is final?</utterance>
<utterance turn="507" who="rizwanp">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="508" who="rizwanp">reyens has a good point</utterance>
<utterance turn="509" who="saroyam">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="510" who="rizwanp">i totally forgot</utterance>
<utterance turn="511" who="rizwanp">it has to be accessible from web</utterance>
<utterance turn="512" who="Michael Clark">Okay. So for the record terminals info is also accessible on website...perhaps with a location map.</utterance>
<utterance turn="513" who="rizwanp">sure</utterance>
<utterance turn="514" who="kaspara">Yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="515" who="Michael Clark">Done.</utterance>
<utterance turn="517" who="reynens">Yes, the main website should have a map to the hospital :P</utterance>
<utterance turn="516" who="Michael Clark">Q12. What is an expected volume of visitors on a daily basis that will potentially be interacting with the new system instead of talking to the person at the information desk?</utterance>
<utterance turn="518" who="gosselinc">thousands</utterance>
<utterance turn="520" who="nguyenh">arounbd 50$</utterance>
<utterance turn="519" who="rizwanp">let's say on average a patient has 5 relatives</utterance>
<utterance turn="521" who="rizwanp">that care about him</utterance>
<utterance turn="522" who="rizwanp">or her</utterance>
<utterance turn="523" who="nguyenh">50%</utterance>
<utterance turn="524" who="rizwanp">50% what?</utterance>
<utterance turn="525" who="gosselinc">?</utterance>
<utterance turn="526" who="kaspara">I'mm uhhhhhh lost</utterance>
<utterance turn="527" who="saroyam">let try and type one sentence on the same line</utterance>
<utterance turn="528" who="rizwanp">ur still here?</utterance>
<utterance turn="529" who="Michael Clark">We are looking for a number as to the number of users the terminals and website need to support.</utterance>
<utterance turn="530" who="reynens">we already decided how many people go into the hospital and Thanh is saying 50%</utterance>
<utterance turn="531" who="nguyenh">50% of the visiotr will use the info booth rather than the helpddesk</utterance>
<utterance turn="532" who="rizwanp">why?</utterance>
<utterance turn="533" who="Michael Clark">Ok.</utterance>
<utterance turn="534" who="reynens">so 2000 a day?</utterance>
<utterance turn="535" who="corbettj">ultimately everyone should be using the terminals...</utterance>
<utterance turn="536" who="saroyam">yeah 2000 sounds good</utterance>
<utterance turn="537" who="reynens">thats not final Mike</utterance>
<utterance turn="538" who="rizwanp">wait</utterance>
<utterance turn="539" who="Michael Clark">Final for RS 1.0?</utterance>
<utterance turn="540" who="rizwanp">2000?</utterance>
<utterance turn="541" who="corbettj">it will come down to how comfortable people are using them</utterance>
<utterance turn="542" who="reynens">no no, in the conversation</utterance>
<utterance turn="543" who="chiuo">2000 for web?</utterance>
<utterance turn="544" who="rizwanp">whoa whoa</utterance>
<utterance turn="545" who="reynens">oh, good question</utterance>
<utterance turn="546" who="chiuo">are we having web and terminal separate?</utterance>
<utterance turn="547" who="nguyenh">of course, but I thikn we should hope half of thenm will use the system</utterance>
<utterance turn="548" who="rizwanp">wtf?</utterance>
<utterance turn="552" who="rizwanp">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="549" who="reynens">QUESTION Are you talking about VISITORS using the TERMINALS?</utterance>
<utterance turn="550" who="rizwanp">no</utterance>
<utterance turn="551" who="corbettj">ok i'll buy that</utterance>
<utterance turn="553" who="chiuo">terminals and the web i believe</utterance>
<utterance turn="554" who="reynens">I'm asking Mike</utterance>
<utterance turn="555" who="rizwanp">why?</utterance>
<utterance turn="556" who="rizwanp">ask me</utterance>
<utterance turn="557" who="nguyenh">only the terminal for now</utterance>
<utterance turn="558" who="reynens">Cause you're in the parking lot</utterance>
<utterance turn="559" who="reynens">okay</utterance>
<utterance turn="560" who="rizwanp">bus stop</utterance>
<utterance turn="561" who="reynens">just terminal use</utterance>
<utterance turn="562" who="rizwanp">but i can be there in 5 min.</utterance>
<utterance turn="563" who="Michael Clark">Technically that was what the question was about. The terminals in the hospital. But if the web is using the same system it would be combined amount.</utterance>
<utterance turn="563" who="Michael Clark">The next question was how many people do you expect to use your website per day.</utterance>
<utterance turn="564" who="rizwanp">depends</utterance>
<utterance turn="566" who="rizwanp">if it's a holiday or workday</utterance>
<utterance turn="565" who="nguyenh">around 20  00</utterance>
<utterance turn="567" who="corbettj">JUST A NOTE: check the time VS how many discussion items are left</utterance>
<utterance turn="568" who="reynens">so we have the number 2000 and corbettj says we would hope all 4000 in/outs (that doesnt count visitors necessarily, just patient)</utterance>
<utterance turn="569" who="nguyenh">20 000 =  5 * 4000</utterance>
<utterance turn="570" who="rizwanp">20,000?</utterance>
<utterance turn="571" who="Michael Clark">20000 works. Lets move on.</utterance>
<utterance turn="572" who="corbettj">we should hope for all, but ultimately some people won't be confortable</utterance>
<utterance turn="573" who="rizwanp">wtf</utterance>
<utterance turn="574" who="Michael Clark">Q14. We need a clear picture of how the current system tracks patient records so we can come up with a more accurate and efficient method. How are inaccuracies introduced to your current system, and what are they? What would make patient records more efficient and accessible to doctors and nurses?</utterance>
<utterance turn="575" who="rizwanp">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="576" who="reynens">Riz, you're IT</utterance>
<utterance turn="577" who="rizwanp">let me talk about inaccuracies</utterance>
<utterance turn="578" who="rizwanp">everyone else shut</utterance>
<utterance turn="579" who="rizwanp">first</utterance>
<utterance turn="580" who="rizwanp">database is updated manually, as in info is typed in</utterance>
<utterance turn="581" who="rizwanp">so typos</utterance>
<utterance turn="582" who="rizwanp">ok</utterance>

<utterance turn="590" who="nguyenh">because we have 3 system right now</utterance>
<utterance turn="591" who="nguyenh">so everything should be in 1</utterance>
<utterance turn="592" who="nguyenh">-&gt; less typing</utterance>

<utterance turn="679" who="Michael Clark">Next.</utterance>
<utterance turn="680" who="Michael Clark">Q5. The problem description states that you are looking for a way of tracking the location of supplies, equipment and patients. Under section 4.0 of the RFP v1.0 the requirement to know the location of doctors and nurses is also stated. Do you want the location tracking of people to extend to research personnel, administration staff and security staff as well?</utterance>
<utterance turn="681" who="reynens">most definitely above all</utterance>
<utterance turn="682" who="reynens">wait, wrong question to answer</utterance>
<utterance turn="683" who="reynens">*scratch</utterance>
<utterance turn="684" who="nguyenh">Yes, that would be nice</utterance>
<utterance turn="685" who="corbettj">i don't think the location of doctors and nurses is supposed to be tracked</utterance>
<utterance turn="686" who="reynens">i thought we decided not to go with that?</utterance>
<utterance turn="688" who="reynens">is it still in?</utterance>
<utterance turn="687" who="saroyam">yeah no tracking of doctors or staff</utterance>
<utterance turn="689" who="reynens">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="690" who="reynens">no doctors, no staff</utterance>
<utterance turn="693" who="reynens">they can commit crimes and we will not know</utterance>
<utterance turn="691" who="gosselinc">just patients</utterance>
<utterance turn="692" who="rizwanp">where did we say we wanna track doctors and nurses?</utterance>
<utterance turn="694" who="Michael Clark">Okay, the RFP said you wanted to know where they were... and that would imply  tracking...</utterance>
<utterance turn="695" who="nguyenh">why?</utterance>
<utterance turn="696" who="nguyenh">they should be track right?</utterance>
<utterance turn="697" who="kaspara">Doctors may be a good idea....</utterance>
<utterance turn="698" who="saroyam">i think that was supposed to be taken out</utterance>
<utterance turn="699" who="nguyenh">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="700" who="rizwanp">i don't see anything like that in 4.0</utterance>
<utterance turn="701" who="reynens">i can't remember a date, but i remember us scratching docs off the list</utterance>
<utterance turn="702" who="rizwanp">can u copy and paste?</utterance>
<utterance turn="703" who="reynens">you broke the rfp riz</utterance>

<utterance turn="706" who="corbettj">hehehe</utterance>
<utterance turn="707" who="rizwanp">i'm serious</utterance>
<utterance turn="708" who="Michael Clark">Section 4.0 Doctors.</utterance>
<utterance turn="709" who="gosselinc">..... What's section 4.0?</utterance>
<utterance turn="710" who="rizwanp">Must be able to access information about current patients. The information should include their location in the hospital, a record of all administered medication, a listing of any scheduled operations, a history of their previous visits to the hospital, etc.</utterance>

<utterance turn="713" who="Michael Clark">or would it be desirable.</utterance>
<utterance turn="714" who="corbettj">that's information that they should be able to access about the patients</utterance>

<utterance turn="726" who="Michael Clark">Yes, so for the record.... no tracking of staff.</utterance>
<utterance turn="727" who="reynens">**update, SAVE EVERYTHING SAID HERE</utterance>
<utterance turn="728" who="corbettj">correct</utterance>
<utterance turn="729" who="Michael Clark">Q19. Similarly with the above, what types of supplies will require tracking devices on them? An estimate of how many would be helpful, and if the tracking device would need to be moved from one item to another often.</utterance>
<utterance turn="730" who="saroyam">blood packs</utterance>
<utterance turn="731" who="saroyam">donor items</utterance>
<utterance turn="732" who="reynens">needles = no</utterance>

<utterance turn="736" who="rizwanp">ok we can't decide right now</utterance>
<utterance turn="737" who="Michael Clark">Okay. So once they reach the warehouse it is up to staff to enter the room number where they are headed.</utterance>
<utterance turn="738" who="rizwanp">but we can let u know</utterance>
<utterance turn="739" who="kaspara">Supplies need to be tracked in the incoming warehouse too</utterance>
<utterance turn="740" who="corbettj">it would be nice if you could just track when a consumable item is removed from it's respective storage area....then you would know that it was in the process of being used up so you could replace it</utterance>
<utterance turn="741" who="Michael Clark">Yes, a isle and shelf number for the warehouse or something similar.</utterance>
<utterance turn="742" who="nguyenh">something like that</utterance>
<utterance turn="743" who="reynens">think in terms of programming</utterance>

<utterance turn="770" who="rizwanp">u retard</utterance>
<utterance turn="771" who="Michael Clark">Q24. Is there a concern for staff and/or patients removing the tracking devices? Is additional security required in attaching tracking devices to equipment?</utterance>

<utterance turn="776" who="Michael Clark">Q26. What sort of control (if any) is required to ensure that all items are signed-out properly to keep the inventory in the system accurate? For example, is there a storeroom a couple of employees manage, or will an automated vending-machine need to interface with the system?</utterance>
<utterance turn="777" who="rizwanp">wait wait</utterance>
<utterance turn="778" who="reynens">Riz, "dogs" is better than what you've said</utterance>
