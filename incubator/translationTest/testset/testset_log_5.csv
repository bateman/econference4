4;longleyl;Matthew still needs to get invited;
5;andrews;http://segal.cs.uvic.ca/seng321/econference/howto.html;
6;longleyl;I think that's everyone.;
7;andrews;for instructions on how to scribe;
8;Geoff Spears;we are still waiting for one person;
9;neal;yep he is sitting next to me and still having trouble;
10;longleyl;There he is.;
11;Geoff Spears;..... and begin;
12;Geoff Spears;we are going to start with -1 person;
13;Geoff Spears;never mind hes here;
14;Saj;Sorry for the delay.;
15;Geoff Spears;no prob;
16;longleyl;So shall we begin?;
17;Ryan;go ahead;
18;Geoff Spears;jack please put up a random decision;
19;chaingj;damn;
20;chaingj;I can't clik;
21;longleyl;Don't you just click in the decisions place and type?;
22;Geoff Spears;try now;
23;longleyl;Okay, it works/.;
24;Geoff Spears;ok we just needed to test the decisiion pane;
25;whitew;hello;
26;Geoff Spears;dsdsd;
27;Geoff Spears;test;
28;whitew;we have problems;
29;longleyl;Problems?;
30;Geoff Spears;abort;
31;longleyl;???;
32;Geoff Spears;we lost the conversation ;
33;neal;?;
34;diazj;did we?;
35;whitew;we linux guys can't see any thing;
36;Matthew;whats wrong?;
37;whitew;dfg;
38;chaingj;doh;
39;Saj;Where's our moderator?;
40;diazj;he is back;
41;Ryan;back now;
42;chaingj;yo;
43;Geoff Spears;ok I'm back on;
44;gravesr;back;
45;whitew;PM works;
46;chaingj;I can't see people;
47;Geoff Spears;did anyone else get blocked from the conversation;
48;neal;nope;
49;gravesr;I got kicked off, might be wireless;
50;chaingj;I can't see people on Who's On;
51;longleyl;You're also posting in duplicate.;
52;longleyl;And so am I, apparently.;
53;Geoff Spears;I think that anyone using linux cannot see the messages that we are typng;
54;neal;we all get your message so don't worry about it;
55;andrews;we're in 2 sessions;
56;chaingj;ok;
57;chaingj;I relogin;
58;diazj;when are we starting?;
59;Geoff Spears;we cannot make formal decisions;
60;Geoff Spears;or else anyone using linux including myself gets booted;
61;Matthew;we are losing some people;
62;neal;great tool;
63;Geoff Spears;ok well any dev team that is connected do you have any q's;
64;Ryan;Let's switch back to MSN, lol;
65;longleyl;Well, I guess a good place to start is to ask what the client team thought of the prototype demo and if they have any concerns that came up as a result of it.;
66;Geoff Spears;yeah;
67;Geoff Spears;whats the viewability of the prototype;
68;Geoff Spears;is it online that we can view it further;
69;longleyl;As in what?;
70;Saj;there is one computer free here if anyone is having too much problems.;
71;whitew;Does the client have a web url so we can view the prototype our selves?;
72;neal;http://clarkmultimedia.com/school/seng321/developer/prototype/;
73;Geoff Spears;ok;
74;Geoff Spears;how does the prototype allow people to view the bookings that are either public or of lower priority than themselves;
75;neal;it is not a full prototype;
76;neal;"if it were it would be ""the"" system";
77;Geoff Spears;right;
78;Geoff Spears;you are correct sir;
79;Geoff Spears;what is the focus component that you guys are going to do for RS3.0;
80;longleyl;"In the actual system, I believe that clicking on ""Booking Schedule"" under a room you found would enable you to view when it's booked, and if a booking was public, you could click on it and see the specifics about it.";
81;neal;we were thinking about the sheduling and booking functionality;
82;Ryan;geoff, could you invite andrew;
83;Geoff Spears;what is his username;
84;longleyl;andrews;
85;Geoff Spears;k;
86;diazj;just andrew;
87;Ryan;"just ""andrew";
88;Geoff Spears;did he get the invite;
89;Geoff Spears;?;
90;Matthew;dont think so;
91;Geoff Spears;dang;
92;Ryan;not yet;
93;whitew;How have you addressed booking multiple rooms and reoccurring bookings??;
94;longleyl;Administrators are the only ones who can book multiple rooms at a time.;
95;Geoff Spears;but how about reoccurring bookings;
96;neal;same;
97;Geoff Spears;but regalr users should be able to book for reoccuring events;
98;neal;unless you want some permission to allow certain users thoes features;
99;neal;or should i just be open to any user;
100;whitew;Is that demonstrated on the prototype at all?;
101;Matthew;no;
102;longleyl;No.;
103;Geoff Spears;suppose we had a regular meeting time on a friday afternoon;
104;neal;nope, i will have to add a checkbox saying recurring;
105;Geoff Spears;we would want to book a room for the semester or something;
106;Ryan;Geoff, would you invite andrew again;
107;Ryan;"""andrew""";
108;neal;what time periods do you want to be able to have recurring;
109;neal;weekly, monthly, every so many days;
110;Geoff Spears;whats andrews last name;
111;longleyl;Scott.;
112;Geoff Spears;ok;
113;Geoff Spears;is andrew in yet;
114;Ryan;seems not;
115;neal;"so we have 27 ;minutes left i suggest we get started deciding what is going into rs 3.0";
116;neal;is andrew even here;
117;diazj;he is in the solaris room;
118;Ryan;he's there;
119;Ryan;but the econf can't be invited;
120;Matthew;did he get the new version?;
121;neal;i think we should just get started and fill him in later;
122;neal;or we will not have time to finish;
123;Matthew;there he is;
124;diazj;good idea;
125;Andrew;about time;
126;Geoff Spears;well I would like to see one single click to enter into a state where you know that you are booking a room;
127;neal;?;
128;Saj;for the recurrence, I think most of them would be either weekly or monthly. Some may be biweekly. The users should be given those options for sure.;
129;Geoff Spears;it seems obscure to me to have to go through room search first;
130;Matthew;like one click to see where u book or not?;
131;Ryan;"is that ""My Bookings""?";
132;Geoff Spears;maybe just a button for book room that leads through to the room searh page;
133;Geoff Spears;so its more intuitive;
134;neal;well say you have 10 buildings, 4 floors each, and 5 rooms a floor, that is a lot of rooms;
135;Lucas Longley;"So, like, you click ""book room"" and then it prompts you to either browse or search for a room?";
136;Geoff Spears;ya;
137;neal;can do;
138;neal;you guys should set another scribe;
139;Geoff Spears;but the scribe cant write a decision though;
140;Andrew;and set an agenda;
141;neal;why not;
142;Lucas Longley;It apparently crashed the program to do so.;
143;Geoff Spears;i get disconnected when a decision is made;
144;neal;i thought that was the purpose of a scribe;
145;Andrew;whoa;
146;Geoff Spears;andrew welcome back;
147;Andrew;that harsh sucks;
148;Geoff Spears;10 invites lter;
149;neal;lucas you are repeating yourself in triplicate now;
150;Lucas Longley;Yeah, I know.;
151;Lucas Longley;This program needs a little work.;
152;neal;you don't say;
153;Geoff Spears;i agree;
154;neal;not you too;
155;Geoff Spears;i agree;
156;Saj;Can we go through the issues quickly before things get worse?;
157;Andrew;ok, so a screen thatll let you choose browsing or searching sounds reasonable;
158;Andrew;lets work through this;
159;Geoff Spears;yeah i was just thinking so that if your intent is to book a room then you can click book room immediately;
160;Andrew;ill record this in word;
161;Lucas Longley;Right, makes sense.;
162;Geoff Spears;sounds good;
163;neal;this conference is intended to also decide what is going into rs 3.0;
164;Geoff Spears;are you going to do the display public events portion for the final product;
165;Geoff Spears;yes;
166;Andrew;so if you know the room you want you can go right to it;
167;Geoff Spears;what part of the project are you going to focus on for 3.0;
168;neal;who can book a public event;
169;Geoff Spears;anyone;
170;neal;ya thats not hard;
171;Geoff Spears;the difference is that anyone including non logged in users can view the booking;
172;Ryan;that make sense;
173;neal;so that would include most stuff booked by faculty;
174;neal;it course bookings;
175;neal;*ie;
176;leungj;is the function for non user to view the booking include?;
177;leungj;i mean in the prototype;
178;Ryan;not in the prototype,;
179;Geoff Spears;say I booked a room in the sub for a presentation I would want anyone to be able to come not just users ;
180;Geoff Spears;so an option to set the viewablilty of a boooking;
181;Andrew;I have a question about the room booking menu: what do you want on it? Do you want just browse and search? Or did you want somthing else as well where you could do somthing more direct? I didn't understand your full intention;
182;neal;a check box saying public or private would work fine;
183;Geoff Spears;on the main page just a shortcut to the browse or search page that is labelled book room is what i am thinking;
184;neal;ok ;
185;neal;so if a room is public eveyone can see what its booked for, but if its not public then what;
186;neal;do you want authenticated users to see what its booked for;
187;neal;your rfp didn't mention a booking name or descriptiong;
188;Geoff Spears;no but they can only view public bookings that it;
189;Matthew;another Question, does the public user need to get an ID and password from the admin  before they can book a room?;
190;Geoff Spears;thats it*;
191;neal;so making a booking public would only show that the room is booked;
192;Geoff Spears;possibly a title too;
193;Geoff Spears;"such as ""beer fest"" sub # 103";
194;neal;do you want to add a title and description to the booking;
195;Geoff Spears;perhaps optional;
196;neal;well i would think a title would be very usefull;
197;leungj;a question from the prototype when you click on booking schedule, you only display schedule of a particular month, can user view next month schedule as well;
198;Matthew;thats not a problem;
199;;yes..its just the prototype;
200;neal;mech 343, or beer fest;
201;Geoff Spears;yeah titles should be included for sure;
202;Geoff Spears;otherwise its meaningless to view bookings;
203;Ryan;we will list the following couple of month later, not only current;
204;neal;what about a quick option description;
205;neal;well not meaningless it just depends what you want the system to do;
206;neal;you are expanding from room booking to events calendar;
207;Andrew;let's not get into symantecs;
208;Geoff Spears;well if you have a faculty meeting and all it says is that room 103 is booked and not that its the meeting thats pretty meaningless;
209;neal;it makes a difference with how we approach the problem;
210;neal;an events calendar focuses more on design and less on booking functionality and vise versa;
211;Andrew;Well, since we've already focused on functionality, lets stay focused there and just add a description;
212;Geoff Spears;i thought that viewing public bookings and such was always a part;
213;Geoff Spears;but i could be mistaken;
214;neal;yes but you never specified the title or description therefore the public could just see when the room was booked and no details would be displayed;
215;neal;which if the purpose of the system was simply to help potential bookers find a suiteable room would be sufficient;
216;Geoff Spears;you could be right;
217;Andrew;adding a title is easy;
218;Andrew;next issue;
219;Geoff Spears;but I think it woul be a good idea to include that;
220;Geoff Spears;if it wasnt included previously;
221;whitew;That should be the way it is, public should see room booked, but no details;
222;leungj;that's sound good;
223;Matthew;so should we include that?;
224;Geoff Spears;i think so ;
225;Saj;so what was the complete decision?;
226;neal;unless it is set to public and then the public can see everything;
227;neal;ie a concert;
228;Geoff Spears;ya;
229;neal;ok done and done;
230;Geoff Spears;if its faculty then the faculty can see it;
231;Geoff Spears;and its info but students can only see its booked;
232;Andrew;you mean if;
233;neal;that doesn't make sence at all;
234;neal;if the public can see the concert and that time, then they know its booked;
235;whitew;which part?;
236;whitew;yes;
237;Geoff Spears;if its a faculty meeting then the faculty can see the booking duration and the relevant information but students can only see that the room is  booked;
238;neal;but then what was all that about only students seeing it;
239;Andrew;"you said ""unless it is set to public and then the public can see everything""";
240;neal;but all that info would show up on the calendar;
241;Geoff Spears;i accidentally hit enter mid message;
242;Andrew;"it should be ""if it is set to public and then the public can see everything""";
243;neal;because if a concert is going from 9:00pm to 1:am then its obvious that its booked;
244;neal;and what time it's booked form;
245;Matthew;what other student? can they see the detail of other student booking a room?;
246;Geoff Spears;but in theory you would want people to attend the concert so telling them its a concert during that time would be very usesful;
247;neal;?;
248;Matthew;^ about;
249;Lucas Longley;Shouldn't we skip to RS 3.0?  We were going to talk about it but got sidetracked, and there are only five minutes.;
250;gravesr;I suppose one way to say it is that a user from the same class of user can see the details of the booking, but all other user classes can only see the general stuff;
251;Andrew;I think we have this sorted on our end;
252;Ryan;"public=show booked status with event detail; private=show booked status only? is that correct";
253;Andrew;"Bookings, private or public for viewing, checkbox? Public bookings, optional title
 
Private, only groups can see details, or bookers. Ie faculty can see all faculty booked items, students can only see items that they book themselves.";
254;neal;ok 4 minutes left;
255;whitew;Well it looks like maybe one decision was made.;
256;Andrew;can we move on?;
257;Lucas Longley;What happened to talking about RS 3.0?;
258;whitew;why u  asking rs3?;
259;Lucas Longley;I thought we were supposed to talk about that briefly.;
260;whitew;does the dev team have any questions for client?;
261;neal;because that is the purpose of the meeting to decide what feature to implement in rs 3.0;
262;chaingj;man, your can type message three time at once, you are good;
263;Lucas Longley;Yes, the software gives me the speed of three typers in one.;
264;diazj;no, we are not supposed to tell you what is the most important feature of the system. You should decide that;
265;whitew;what was dev teams suggestion again;
266;neal;yes ;
267;neal;and negociate exactly what its going to be;
268;Lucas Longley;Suggestion  for what?;
269;neal;you have to decide that what wer are going to develop is satisfactory;
270;Saj;"""Book a room"" sounds like the most important functionality to me.";
271;Andrew;I think probably the most important part is probably making bookings;
272;neal;i already suggested that we do room booking and calendar display;
273;neal;because they are closely related;
274;Geoff Spears;i think that was our intention of the system from the start;
275;Andrew;deal;
276;chaingj;right;
277;Ryan;What else should we need to promote for the system;
278;Andrew;lets shake on it;
279;Geoff Spears;shake shake;
280;chaingj;shake what;
281;chaingj;d?;
282;Andrew;i'm vigoriously shaking my laptop;
283;whitew;me too;
284;diazj;me too;
285;Lucas Longley;Okay, so RS 3.0 will be on room booking and calendar display?;
286;Andrew;i hope i didn't fuck up my hardrive;
287;chaingj;I am shaking the computer monitor now;
288;neal;we will not do user roles;
289;whitew;Sounds good to me;
290;Geoff Spears;ok;
291;Lucas Longley;Okey doke, that sounds good.;
292;neal;there will be public users, and authenticated user;
293;neal;s;
294;Geoff Spears;ok;
295;Saj;we can save user roles for RS 4.0;
296;leungj;sounds good;
297;neal;what about room search;
298;neal;or do you just want to select from the building list;
299;diazj;there is not RS4.0;
300;Lucas Longley;I assume that was a joke.;
301;Geoff Spears;authenticated can see all authenticated and public bookings, public users only view public bookings;
302;Andrew;alright, i gotta burn;
303;neal;i say building list so that we can focus on bookings and display;
304;whitew;room search size, resources;
305;whitew;just like that;
306;Geoff Spears;later;
307;Lucas Longley;See you.;
308;Lucas Longley;I'll see you three times, in fact.;
309;Matthew;we over ?;
310;Ryan;I think so;
311;neal;time is up;
312;chaingj;okie duckie;
313;Geoff Spears;have we got the info required;
314;Geoff Spears;?;
315;neal;does the client team have any other questions before we go;
316;Saj;or are we planning to have another meeting?;
317;neal;well i think everything has been discussed;
318;whitew;I have no more q's;
319;neal;unless you have other questions;
320;chaingj;ok;
321;Geoff Spears;i think so as well;
322;leungj;no more;
323;Lucas Longley;Okey doke.;
324;Matthew;alrite guys..;

334;chaingj;bye;
335;Geoff Spears;try for 6x;

337;chaingj;crash the server;
338;Lucas Longley;If you go to Chat > Join a room and join the room you're already in, it just sends your message again.;
339;neal;hmm, lets se if i can do it;
340;diazj;so, are we done?;
341;chaingj;done;
