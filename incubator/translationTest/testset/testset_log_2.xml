<utterance turn="60" who="laihok">Matthew</utterance>
<utterance turn="61" who="longleyl">I dunno where he is.</utterance>
<utterance turn="62" who="clarkn">don't know not on my list</utterance>
<utterance turn="63" who="laihok">ok..</utterance>
<utterance turn="64" who="longleyl">The teacher just told us to start without Andrew.</utterance>
<utterance turn="65" who="laihok">we need to start</utterance>
<utterance turn="66" who="clarkn">oh now he showed up</utterance>
<utterance turn="67" who="longleyl">Good timing.</utterance>
<utterance turn="68" who="chenl">who still  not coming yet</utterance>
<utterance turn="69" who="clarkn">doesn't matter lets just start</utterance>
<utterance turn="70" who="Jared Haines">ok, let's get this thing started</utterance>
<utterance turn="71" who="Jared Haines">So, first we'd like to know a little more about the system.  Are you looking for some sort of web-based service, or a desktop application?</utterance>
<utterance turn="72" who="clarkn">a desktop application</utterance>
<utterance turn="73" who="longleyl">It's supposed to be a decentralized, distributed thing, nothing on a central server.</utterance>
<utterance turn="74" who="Jared Haines">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="75" who="clarkn">the users of the system will need to connect from a large number of different locations</utterance>
<utterance turn="76" who="mcknightp">So web access but not a web page?</utterance>
<utterance turn="77" who="clarkn">exactly,</utterance>
<utterance turn="77" who="clarkn">we are looking for a desktop applicaitons, where the load of running the system is spread amongst the connected clients</utterance>
<utterance turn="78" who="laihok">yes...not a web page..its a actual program</utterance>
<utterance turn="79" who="chenl">the users are albe to view the cal via the webpage</utterance>
<utterance turn="80" who="Jared Haines">so this will be a client application which sends and receives information to and from the web server?</utterance>
<utterance turn="81" who="clarkn">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="81" who="clarkn">but that is not where the information is stored</utterance>
<utterance turn="82" who="clarkn">public information will be posted to a webserver</utterance>
<utterance turn="83" who="chenl">all the infomation just store locally,</utterance>
<utterance turn="84" who="clarkn">on the various cleint machines</utterance>
<utterance turn="85" who="clarkn">information you are permitted to view is stored on the local client computer</utterance>
<utterance turn="86" who="mcknightp">So if someone is not online how can someone else invite them to a meeting?</utterance>
<utterance turn="87" who="clarkn">?</utterance>
<utterance turn="89" who="clarkn">this software is not a meeting software, it is a calendar applicaiton</utterance>
<utterance turn="88" who="mcknightp">FOr example</utterance>
<utterance turn="90" who="mcknightp">I'm offline and so is my schedule</utterance>
<utterance turn="91" who="mcknightp">you need to schedule me for a meeting</utterance>
<utterance turn="92" who="mcknightp">how do you know my schedule?</utterance>
<utterance turn="93" who="chenl">email notice will be sent</utterance>
<utterance turn="94" who="clarkn">well the informaiton will be stored on other client computers, for example if a manager puts out a meeting schedule it will be send to everyone in the meeting</utterance>
<utterance turn="96" who="clarkn">the computers in our organization are left running all night so uptime is not a big consideration</utterance>
<utterance turn="95" who="longleyl">And the person can retrieve the info when they log on, and such.</utterance>
<utterance turn="97" who="mcknightp">ok what about, laptops and buisness trips?</utterance>
<utterance turn="98" who="clarkn">well when they connect the new  events  will bo downloaded from other peers</utterance>
<utterance turn="99" who="laihok">pretty much the same..once you are online</utterance>
<utterance turn="100" who="chenl">think about the idea of bittorrent, you can download as a peer from anywhere</utterance>
<utterance turn="101" who="clarkn">the mechanisims for distributing the data are not all that important at this point, what we need to concentrate on is the scheduling functionality of the software</utterance>
<utterance turn="102" who="clarkn">information isn't just retrieved at login time, it can also be downloaded as it becomes available</utterance>
<utterance turn="103" who="clarkn">and affected users can give feedback on the proposed schedule</utterance>
<utterance turn="104" who="longleyl">Essentially, it should check both at login and periodically to see if anything has changed, and if so, get the new information.</utterance>
<utterance turn="105" who="longleyl">It's a continuous process.</utterance>
<utterance turn="106" who="clarkn">exactly</utterance>
<utterance turn="107" who="Jared Haines">The RFP mentioned that documents are often sent out to be read prior to a meeting.  Does the application need to distribute the documents, or will they be sent out by email?</utterance>
<utterance turn="108" who="laihok">you can upload the document</utterance>
<utterance turn="109" who="longleyl">The application will distribute them with the meeting notice, kind of like an email attachment.</utterance>
<utterance turn="110" who="clarkn">yes, it does need to distribute documens and no they will not be sent out by email</utterance>
<utterance turn="111" who="chaingj">email notice will be send</utterance>
<utterance turn="112" who="laihok">like an attachment</utterance>
<utterance turn="113" who="chenl">just email notice</utterance>
<utterance turn="114" who="clarkn">for important items only</utterance>
<utterance turn="115" who="clarkn">the user should be able to select if they want an email sent, in general it will not be necessary as the calendar will display the updates</utterance>
<utterance turn="116" who="Jared Haines">ok, we should probably move on</utterance>
<utterance turn="117" who="Jared Haines">What kinds of user permissions will the system need?</utterance>
<utterance turn="118" who="chenl">either set the cal event to private or public</utterance>
<utterance turn="119" who="longleyl">Well, you should be able to define an arbitrary number of user permissions and give them all a variable set of abilities.</utterance>
<utterance turn="120" who="longleyl">I believe.</utterance>
<utterance turn="122" who="chenl">and depends on the group which you choose</utterance>
<utterance turn="121" who="clarkn">they system will need a role based permission system, where by and arbitrary number of rolls can be created and assigned to various users</utterance>
<utterance turn="123" who="clarkn">for example managers should be able to schedule meetings for the staff they manage</utterance>
<utterance turn="125" who="clarkn">or request a meeting with people from other departemnts</utterance>
<utterance turn="124" who="longleyl">Essentially, the system will have a various set of things people can do.</utterance>
<utterance turn="126" who="longleyl">And you can derive user classes from that set.</utterance>
<utterance turn="127" who="laihok">for example, the manger always has permission to do , update, edit, delete the schedule</utterance>
<utterance turn="128" who="clarkn">a mail clerk for exampel should not be able to change the time or a meeting or schedule a meeting</utterance>
<utterance turn="129" who="chaingj">or payroll accountant can't change time :)</utterance>
<utterance turn="130" who="Jared Haines">Will certain users have higher priority permissions? For example, if one manager changes a schedule could another manager override the edit, or modify a calendar entry made by another user?</utterance>
<utterance turn="131" who="clarkn">but the hr people can put out a schedule for all staff under thier control</utterance>
<utterance turn="132" who="clarkn">but for tiems like that the person scheduled can request that their schedule be changed</utterance>
<utterance turn="133" who="longleyl">I believe that people above someone in the hierarchy can affect people below them, but people can't affect others in the same level of the hierarchy.</utterance>
<utterance turn="134" who="longleyl">Unless the person explicitly gives them permission to do so.</utterance>
<utterance turn="136" who="chaingj">have to negociate before change~~~</utterance>
<utterance turn="135" who="clarkn">when creating a schedule the system should try to optimize the timing of a meeting to minimize existing conflitcs</utterance>
<utterance turn="137" who="clarkn">so a method to request different times</utterance>
<utterance turn="138" who="clarkn">that way staff can schedule themselves as long as they get their hours in</utterance>
<utterance turn="139" who="clarkn">when scheduling the system takes requests into consideration</utterance>
<utterance turn="140" who="mcknightp">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="140" who="mcknightp">hold up a sec please</utterance>
<utterance turn="141" who="mcknightp">Permissions</utterance>
<utterance turn="142" who="mcknightp">Do you need mutlilevel premissions for each person in the tree?</utterance>
<utterance turn="143" who="longleyl">What do you mean by "multilevel permissions"?</utterance>
<utterance turn="144" who="laihok">what do you mean?</utterance>
<utterance turn="145" who="clarkn">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="145" who="clarkn">a manager can only modify thoes under him</utterance>
<utterance turn="146" who="clarkn">and he is granted his permissions by a administrator</utterance>
<utterance turn="147" who="mcknightp">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="147" who="mcknightp">can a manager have two or more priority levels?</utterance>
<utterance turn="148" who="clarkn">rolls are set up my administrators and then assigned to the staff</utterance>
<utterance turn="149" who="longleyl">No, being a manager sets his priority level.</utterance>
<utterance turn="150" who="longleyl">I'm not sure what you mean.</utterance>
<utterance turn="151" who="clarkn">a manager can belong to multiple roles</utterance>
<utterance turn="152" who="chenl">why we need multilevel, would you give some example</utterance>
<utterance turn="153" who="clarkn">say a manager is in charge of a group of programmers</utterance>
<utterance turn="154" who="clarkn">that manager can then schedule thoes programmers</utterance>
<utterance turn="155" who="clarkn">he may also be the team leader of another project</utterance>
<utterance turn="156" who="longleyl">Oh, right, that makes sense.</utterance>
<utterance turn="157" who="longleyl">I guess that you could organize it in a tree structure.</utterance>
<utterance turn="158" who="longleyl">Where everyone below someone can have something scheduled by the person above them.</utterance>
<utterance turn="159" who="chenl">I thought the permission is associated with each event,</utterance>
<utterance turn="160" who="clarkn">he can request that other people not under his controll attend a meeting put he has to request their presence and they have to accept before they can be added to the meeting</utterance>
<utterance turn="162" who="clarkn">they can also schedule their own events as long as they don't conflict</utterance>
<utterance turn="163" who="clarkn">ie, work on project A until such a time, then work on project B</utterance>
<utterance turn="161" who="longleyl">So in that case, the programmers would be below the person and so would the other team.</utterance>
<utterance turn="164" who="andrews">hey guys sorry im late</utterance>
<utterance turn="165" who="clarkn">sorry we are done ;)</utterance>
<utterance turn="166" who="longleyl">Haha.</utterance>
<utterance turn="167" who="clarkn">we have decided you are coding the entire project</utterance>
<utterance turn="168" who="clarkn">we had a vote and everyone agreed</utterance>
<utterance turn="169" who="longleyl">And all profits will go to us.</utterance>
<utterance turn="170" who="chaingj">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="171" who="mcknightp">so does a given user have different priority levels or just one?</utterance>
<utterance turn="172" who="longleyl">Well, a given user will have people below him, above him, and unassociated with him.</utterance>
<utterance turn="173" who="clarkn">any user can belong to an arbitrary number of roles</utterance>
<utterance turn="174" who="chaingj">depends what kind of job he has</utterance>
<utterance turn="175" who="mcknightp">k</utterance>
<utterance turn="176" who="longleyl">He'd only be able to affect those below him, unless others give him explicit ability to do otherwise.</utterance>
<utterance turn="177" who="clarkn">instead of permission levels i like the idea of roles</utterance>
<utterance turn="178" who="clarkn">that can be assigned and expire when a task is finished</utterance>
<utterance turn="179" who="Jared Haines">yes, I agree the roles concept makes more sense</utterance>
<utterance turn="180" who="longleyl">Well, you could do roles in a tree structure, just a temporary one.</utterance>
<utterance turn="181" who="longleyl">It's just that it'd be hard to model relationships between employees otherwise.</utterance>
<utterance turn="182" who="clarkn">i think of it as being flatter</utterance>
<utterance turn="183" who="clarkn">you have sets of users each with their own permissions</utterance>
<utterance turn="184" who="clarkn">so a group leader can schedule anyone under them even if they are manageing another project</utterance>
<utterance turn="185" who="longleyl">But if you have "managers" and "programmers", how do you define which managers are above which programmers?</utterance>
<utterance turn="186" who="chaingj">the application should be able to create or remove the levels of permission base on role levels</utterance>
<utterance turn="187" who="clarkn">roles</utterance>
<utterance turn="188" who="longleyl">For example.</utterance>
<utterance turn="189" who="clarkn">if someone is assigned the role of project leader of project A then he can manage the schedules for anyone in project A</utterance>
<utterance turn="190" who="chenl">did we dicide to change permission to role</utterance>
<utterance turn="191" who="clarkn">i think so</utterance>
<utterance turn="192" who="longleyl">Ah, so roles would be sort of a grouping mechanism, then.</utterance>
<utterance turn="193" who="clarkn">exactly</utterance>
<utterance turn="194" who="laihok">I think this is better then what we had before</utterance>
<utterance turn="195" who="longleyl">So, you'd have groups of people, and you'd have different level within groups?</utterance>
<utterance turn="196" who="clarkn">if someone is assigned a mananement role they may be able to create new roles and assign anyone under them to that role</utterance>
<utterance turn="197" who="longleyl">That makes sense to me.</utterance>
<utterance turn="198" who="longleyl">Yeah.</utterance>
<utterance turn="199" who="andrews">isn't there a potential for circular logic though?</utterance>
<utterance turn="200" who="clarkn">but they can't escilate their own role</utterance>
<utterance turn="201" who="longleyl">How so?</utterance>
<utterance turn="202" who="longleyl">(to Andrew)</utterance>
<utterance turn="203" who="laihok">I think we'd better to keep the human resource department to do the annouement and things like that</utterance>
<utterance turn="204" who="clarkn">?</utterance>
<utterance turn="205" who="andrews">some people can be part of a group B that can assign tasks to A, where A can assign tasks to B?</utterance>
<utterance turn="206" who="clarkn">well we are going to assume well behaved users</utterance>
<utterance turn="207" who="clarkn">and unless you are a manager you can't create conflicting schedules</utterance>
<utterance turn="208" who="clarkn">so yes you can assign tasks but you can't bump existing tasks</utterance>
<utterance turn="209" who="longleyl">Maybe we should call this good for now and move on; we still have four more topics to cover.</utterance>
<utterance turn="210" who="Jared Haines">ok, we should probably move on before we run out of time</utterance>
<utterance turn="211" who="andrews">i think we're getting a little caught up in the details here anyway</utterance>
<utterance turn="212" who="clarkn">yep</utterance>
<utterance turn="213" who="mcknightp">agreed</utterance>
<utterance turn="214" who="Jared Haines">So, are you going to need some sort of revision control system?</utterance>
<utterance turn="215" who="clarkn">as far as version controll goes only the version that was used is important</utterance>
<utterance turn="216" who="clarkn">if it didn't happen its not important</utterance>
<utterance turn="217" who="Jared Haines">with multiple users updating the schedule there seems to be vast potential for version conflicts</utterance>
<utterance turn="218" who="clarkn">no because they can't update existing items</utterance>
<utterance turn="219" who="clarkn">and plus managers have the final say</utterance>
<utterance turn="221" who="chenl">which the high priority</utterance>
<utterance turn="220" who="chaingj">only certain level can do so</utterance>
<utterance turn="222" who="chaingj">it's be coverd in previous topic</utterance>
<utterance turn="223" who="mcknightp">so a person witht he manager role can edit these docs and thats it?</utterance>
<utterance turn="224" who="clarkn">the docs will be more notices</utterance>
<utterance turn="225" who="clarkn">it read this before the meeting</utterance>
<utterance turn="226" who="clarkn">or here are the notes for the meeting</utterance>
<utterance turn="227" who="andrews">well, everybodys schedual gets distributed to trier machine</utterance>
<utterance turn="228" who="Jared Haines">ok, just clearing that up</utterance>
<utterance turn="229" who="andrews">so that's the schedyal that matters, right?</utterance>
<utterance turn="230" who="andrews">schedule</utterance>
<utterance turn="231" who="clarkn">Meeting Notes will be only editable but the meeting organizer. i think you mean by</utterance>
<utterance turn="232" who="andrews">word</utterance>
<utterance turn="233" who="mcknightp">my bad</utterance>
<utterance turn="234" who="clarkn">no worries</utterance>
<utterance turn="235" who="chaingj">next please...time is flying</utterance>
<utterance turn="236" who="Jared Haines">yep</utterance>
<utterance turn="237" who="clarkn">ok all there really is for this is the following</utterance>
<utterance turn="238" who="clarkn">rols can edit for thoes under them</utterance>
<utterance turn="239" who="clarkn">a user can request that the schedule be changed</utterance>
<utterance turn="240" who="clarkn">the role manager can then run a feature to optimize the requests</utterance>
<utterance turn="241" who="clarkn">and find the best schedule</utterance>
<utterance turn="242" who="clarkn">when teh schedule has been modified, email notice sends out to everyone related in the schedule</utterance>
<utterance turn="243" who="clarkn">i guess we will need various event types, tentative, firm, etc etc</utterance>
<utterance turn="244" who="chenl">good idea</utterance>
<utterance turn="245" who="clarkn">actually their calendar is updated</utterance>
<utterance turn="246" who="andrews">a request can get sent to a manager to change a meeting, or to HR to change the base schedule</utterance>
<utterance turn="247" who="clarkn">emails are only sent out when specifically requested</utterance>
<utterance turn="248" who="clarkn">a request can be sent to any role manager</utterance>
<utterance turn="249" who="andrews">whatever</utterance>
<utterance turn="250" who="Jared Haines">ok, I think that covers it.</utterance>
<utterance turn="250" who="Jared Haines">let's move on</utterance>
<utterance turn="251" who="Jared Haines">Will the backups be local?</utterance>
<utterance turn="252" who="Jared Haines">or will they be backed up on the web server also</utterance>
<utterance turn="253" who="clarkn">yes, but an administrator can also request a global snapshot of the system</utterance>
<utterance turn="254" who="clarkn">from all online users</utterance>
<utterance turn="255" who="chaingj">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="256" who="Jared Haines">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="257" who="Jared Haines">Is there any specific calendar formats your organization uses?</utterance>
<utterance turn="258" who="chaingj">calendar format is complicated to describe man</utterance>
<utterance turn="259" who="clarkn">various depending on the information displayes</utterance>
<utterance turn="260" who="clarkn">d</utterance>
<utterance turn="261" who="clarkn">we want monthly,  weekly, and daily breakdowns</utterance>
<utterance turn="262" who="clarkn">plus the ability to switch between calendars</utterance>
<utterance turn="263" who="chenl">just make sure it's friendly and easy to read</utterance>
<utterance turn="265" who="laihok">ya...user friendly is the most important part</utterance>
<utterance turn="266" who="chaingj">friendly and easy ......</utterance>
<utterance turn="264" who="clarkn">it hr can post your work schedule and then during that time you have various meetings and events</utterance>
<utterance turn="267" who="longleyl">Wait, are you asking about format for storage or format for displaying?</utterance>
<utterance turn="268" who="Jared Haines">display format</utterance>
<utterance turn="269" who="clarkn">and we want clippy</utterance>
<utterance turn="270" who="longleyl">Oh, okay.</utterance>
