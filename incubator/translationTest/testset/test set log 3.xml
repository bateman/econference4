<utterance turn="285" who="scott">i would think 1.5-3 would be a good estimate 
</utterance>
<utterance turn="286" who="Thanh Nguyen">So should we go for approx 5 hours/week?</utterance>
<utterance turn="287" who="Ben">if teacher has specified time for game playing.... 3hrs</utterance>
<utterance turn="288" who="horelj">if they're playing at home as well then 10hrs isn't that bad</utterance>
<utterance turn="289" who="mcknightp">true</utterance>
<utterance turn="290" who="Ben">if kid really likes the game he could put in extra time ... 10 hrs</utterance>
<utterance turn="291" who="ScottReynen">... what was that?</utterance>
<utterance turn="292" who="Chris">Ofcourse we have to have a minimum... say 3...and max 10....</utterance>

<utterance turn="299" who="Mindy">have you decided on 10 hours?</utterance>
<utterance turn="300" who="Aaron K">3hrs/week = minimum?</utterance>
<utterance turn="301" who="Ben">the max of ten hours shouldn't be enforced... kid  should be able to play 50 hrs a week if they want</utterance>
<utterance turn="302" who="">If the kid hates playing then maybe a minimum of 1</utterance>
<utterance turn="303" who="Thanh Nguyen">1-10 it is</utterance>

<utterance turn="320" who="ScottReynen">simmer down, we'll get to that</utterance>
<utterance turn="321" who="Mindy">actually that was my next question</utterance>
<utterance turn="322" who="mcknightp">lol</utterance>
<utterance turn="323" who="Jeff">hehehe</utterance>
<utterance turn="324" who="Ben">ya scott</utterance>
<utterance turn="325" who="Mindy">4. As educators, do you think content should be different for  boys/girls?  Should we just shoot for something in the middle?</utterance>
<utterance turn="326" who="ScottReynen">oh god</utterance>
<utterance turn="327" who="Ben">not different... equal oportunity....</utterance>
<utterance turn="328" who="scott">it should be the same for both</utterance>
<utterance turn="329" who="">possibly presented in different ways</utterance>
<utterance turn="330" who="Jeff">doh! the second i reconnect another decision goes up =/</utterance>
<utterance turn="331" who="riz">me 2</utterance>
<utterance turn="332" who="riz">i can't see anything in the decisions place either</utterance>
<utterance turn="333" who="Ben">i can</utterance>
<utterance turn="334" who="riz">maybe i dunno</utterance>
<utterance turn="335" who="Chris">I agree that content should be the same for all genders. You could have different gender characters though.</utterance>
<utterance turn="336" who="ScottReynen">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="337" who="horelj">the content should be pretty much the same</utterance>
<utterance turn="338" who="Ben">ya</utterance>
<utterance turn="339" who="Mindy">ok moving onto another topic, the system</utterance>
<utterance turn="340" who="ScottReynen">whoa now 
</utterance>
<utterance turn="341" who="Jeff">i'm gonna try a different lab...seems the linux version is bugged :S</utterance>
<utterance turn="342" who="Chris">we move to the next topic :P</utterance>
<utterance turn="343" who="Jeff">back in a few</utterance>
<utterance turn="344" who="Mindy">1. Online backup will be provided by the system. How critical is this information? How far back the backup should go? Maybe one academic year?</utterance>
<utterance turn="345" who="hainesj">one year would be reasonable</utterance>
<utterance turn="346" who="Ben">online?</utterance>
<utterance turn="347" who="scott">one year would be enough</utterance>
<utterance turn="348" who="horelj">one year should be more than enough</utterance>
<utterance turn="349" who="Chris">Shouldnt' student records be kept for longer?</utterance>
<utterance turn="350" who="Ben">one year should be minimum</utterance>
<utterance turn="351" who="Chris">Maybe just exported or something?</utterance>
<utterance turn="352" who="Chris">Is everyone here?</utterance>
<utterance turn="353" who="Mindy">no i think we lost some people</utterance>
<utterance turn="354" who="mcknightp">ya the teachers need some results for marking their students</utterance>
<utterance turn="355" who="ScottReynen">jeff and riz are having tech difficulties</utterance>
<utterance turn="356" who="Aaron K">So, one year is okay, and data is just exported at the end of the year?</utterance>
<utterance turn="357" who="ScottReynen">they werent important anyways (they'll be back)</utterance>
<utterance turn="358" who="hainesj">I think as long as the data can be exported 1 year is a reasonable amount of time to maintain the data in within the system</utterance>
<utterance turn="359" who="scott">that would be good i think</utterance>
<utterance turn="360" who="Ben">can they import old information</utterance>
<utterance turn="361" who="Ben">?</utterance>
<utterance turn="362" who="Chris">Yes that sounds like a good solution. Definately the teacher needs easy access to the students results so far in the year... and with a litlle bit more work from previous years.</utterance>
<utterance turn="363" who="Aaron K">If you want import functionality , we can include it again</utterance>
<utterance turn="364" who="Mindy">does that go into the student record on file at the school?</utterance>
<utterance turn="365" who="Ben">again?</utterance>
<utterance turn="366" who="Ben">it could</utterance>
<utterance turn="367" who="scott">if you cant import old data, what would be the point in saving it?</utterance>
<utterance turn="368" who="horelj">any information older than a year could be exported to a cd or other hard copy and stored if needed at the schools</utterance>
<utterance turn="369" who="ScottReynen">actually, yes, on our specification, i think you questioned why we had importing</utterance>
<utterance turn="370" who="ScottReynen">i'm probably wrong</utterance>
<utterance turn="371" who="hainesj">hmm, maybe we did</utterance>
<utterance turn="372" who="Ben">whatever.... keep the importing</utterance>
<utterance turn="373" who="ScottReynen">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="374" who="Aaron K">Scott is correct</utterance>
<utterance turn="375" who="Aaron K">okayu</utterance>
<utterance turn="376" who="Mindy">has anyone reached  a decision in this or shall we come back to this question</utterance>
<utterance turn="377" who="Aaron K">I thought the decision was that info stays on the system for at least one year....</utterance>
<utterance turn="378" who="Chris">I think we all agree on a 1 year immediate access to data and ability to export the data at the end of the year... ofcourse in need import back in the system and view.</utterance>
<utterance turn="379" who="Ben">sounds good</utterance>
<utterance turn="380" who="Mindy">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="381" who="ScottReynen">so what happens at the end of one year? (sorry)</utterance>
<utterance turn="382" who="horelj">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="383" who="Mindy">2.  For data importing and exporting, Can we do only comma separated files?</utterance>
<utterance turn="384" who="Mindy">That way you can used either Excel, Lotus Notes, etc. to access the data.</utterance>
<utterance turn="385" who="Ben">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="386" who="hainesj">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="387" who="mcknightp">yah</utterance>
<utterance turn="388" who="horelj">that works</utterance>
<utterance turn="389" who="Mindy">3. The system will maintain network security. Will SSL all the communication be sufficient for this requirement?</utterance>
<utterance turn="390" who="Charles">the guy sitting beside me is an idiot</utterance>
<utterance turn="391" who="scott">security is not that important</utterance>
<utterance turn="392" who="scott">ssl  might be overkill</utterance>
<utterance turn="393" who="ScottReynen">is that a consensus?</utterance>
<utterance turn="394" who="horelj">this isn't critical information so i can't see security being a huge deal</utterance>
<utterance turn="395" who="Chris">what if a kid hacks the system and changes its scores?</utterance>
<utterance turn="396" who="mcknightp">if a grade 2 can hack the network then he desires the grade he gave himself</utterance>
<utterance turn="397" who="Chris">i'd say ssl shoul be a good oprion</utterance>
<utterance turn="398" who="ScottReynen">grade 1 and 2?</utterance>
<utterance turn="399" who="scott">if he can do that more power to him</utterance>
<utterance turn="400" who="Ben">agreed</utterance>
<utterance turn="401" who="hainesj">then he gets bonus marks :D</utterance>
<utterance turn="402" who="horelj">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="403" who="Ben">ya security is  not important</utterance>
<utterance turn="404" who="ScottReynen">if a child can do that, he understands problemsolving / math plenty i figure</utterance>
<utterance turn="405" who="Mindy">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="406" who="Chris">ok ok...ah...you are underestimating the knowledge of the future genrations (we have to take account of mutation )</utterance>
<utterance turn="407" who="Ben">no we dont</utterance>
<utterance turn="408" who="Chris">I guess ssl will be an overhead for the system so we can drop that...</utterance>
<utterance turn="409" who="hainesj">I'm pretty sure we didn't mention mutan super-children in the RFP</utterance>
<utterance turn="410" who="Mindy">4 . Data will be portable. Can we just put the data into a standard SQL data base?</utterance>
<utterance turn="411" who="">All SQL databases engine should be able to access the data.</utterance>
<utterance turn="412" who="Ben">sure</utterance>
<utterance turn="413" who="scott">yah</utterance>
<utterance turn="414" who="mcknightp">as long as we can export it to Comma delimited file that should work</utterance>
<utterance turn="415" who="riz">hallo</utterance>
<utterance turn="416" who="Mindy">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="417" who="Chris">If you would like a sugguestion one alternative to CSV is xml, and some db's like oracle can export data directly to xml....just a sugguestion.</utterance>
<utterance turn="418" who="Ben">booo xml</utterance>
<utterance turn="419" who="hainesj">we lost jon again, he needs another invite :(</utterance>
<utterance turn="420" who="Jeff">back :D</utterance>
<utterance turn="421" who="Mindy">oracle is expensive. Do you have licensing for that?</utterance>
<utterance turn="422" who="scott">xml = lots of overhead</utterance>
<utterance turn="423" who="Ben">ya do sql</utterance>
<utterance turn="424" who="Chris">Dude...good luck operating on that csv...</utterance>
<utterance turn="425" who="Mindy">k</utterance>
<utterance turn="426" who="riz">are we actually going to implement this stuff?</utterance>
<utterance turn="427" who="Ben">no</utterance>
<utterance turn="428" who="Charles">riz.. no talking</utterance>
<utterance turn="429" who="ScottReynen">god no son</utterance>
<utterance turn="430" who="Charles">or you might get hit by a bus</utterance>
<utterance turn="431" who="Charles">like this</utterance>
<utterance turn="432" who="ScottReynen">i thought we were rid of Riz</utterance>
<utterance turn="433" who="Jeff">lol</utterance>
<utterance turn="434" who="mcknightp">ROFL</utterance>
<utterance turn="435" who="ScottReynen">i wondered why you'd shut up for so long charles</utterance>
<utterance turn="436" who="Mindy">okkkkkk</utterance>
<utterance turn="437" who="ScottReynen">back to buizness</utterance>
<utterance turn="438" who="Mindy">Online documentation will be available for the game upon completion and delivery.  The game will also come with built in help files and tutorials for game play. 5.   Should we also create a website for the game. Just a place for people to find help, download the game, etc.</utterance>
<utterance turn="439" who="Ben">sure if you want a website that would be good</utterance>
<utterance turn="440" who="ScottReynen">silence Riz please</utterance>
<utterance turn="441" who="scott">yah that would be a bonus but probably not required</utterance>
<utterance turn="442" who="mcknightp">ya sure web site would be nice.</utterance>
<utterance turn="443" who="Ben">were not paying for it though</utterance>
<utterance turn="444" who="Mindy">and neither are we</utterance>
<utterance turn="445" who="Jeff">might be a good way to distribute material add-ons as well :P</utterance>
<utterance turn="446" who="Chris">Well we want well documented code so we can expand on the project...i'd say we take the online Docs.</utterance>
<utterance turn="447" who="Charles">hey mindy... you need to reinvite someone</utterance>
<utterance turn="448" who="Mindy">ok who</utterance>
<utterance turn="449" who="ScottReynen">horelj</utterance>

<utterance turn="460" who="ScottReynen">i can't really say simmer down now, can i</utterance>
<utterance turn="461" who="Mindy">1.  The Maximum time from launching the game until it is playable will be 5 minutes. Should this be ok?</utterance>
<utterance turn="462" who="Chris">NO</utterance>
<utterance turn="463" who="Ben">huh?</utterance>
<utterance turn="464" who="horelj">should be down to 2 minutes</utterance>
<utterance turn="465" who="ScottReynen">what now?</utterance>
<utterance turn="466" who="Ben">5 min is a long ass time to load anything</utterance>
<utterance turn="467" who="ScottReynen">5?</utterance>
<utterance turn="468" who="riz">depends on the system</utterance>
<utterance turn="469" who="mcknightp">can we cut it down to 3?</utterance>
<utterance turn="470" who="Chris">Does that include booting of Windows...cuz  then its acceptable!</utterance>
<utterance turn="471" who="ScottReynen">true</utterance>
<utterance turn="472" who="Jeff">hehehe</utterance>
<utterance turn="473" who="ScottReynen">hold up</utterance>

<utterance turn="476" who="Ben">how about an average of 2 with a max of 5</utterance>
<utterance turn="477" who="ScottReynen">you wanted 16 mb ram computer right?</utterance>
<utterance turn="478" who="Chris">Hahah :0</utterance>
<utterance turn="479" who="ScottReynen">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="480" who="horelj">5 minutes will loose the kids attention</utterance>
<utterance turn="481" who="Chris">Yeah...they'll be well asleep before it launches</utterance>
<utterance turn="482" who="ScottReynen">no no</utterance>
<utterance turn="483" who="ScottReynen">you see</utterance>
<utterance turn="484" who="ScottReynen">we have awesome fun loading screens</utterance>

<utterance turn="488" who="Chris">Haha...and nice relaxing music?</utterance>
<utterance turn="489" who="Charles">we do? i thought we didn't since the game was rated E</utterance>
<utterance turn="490" who="ScottReynen">elevator music, no mini games</utterance>
<utterance turn="491" who="Charles">can't be that nice</utterance>
<utterance turn="492" who="Ben">no wonder it is taking five min to load with all that going on aswell</utterance>
<utterance turn="493" who="ScottReynen">back to seriousness</utterance>
<utterance turn="494" who="ScottReynen">2 min average, with 5 min max?</utterance>

<utterance turn="499" who="riz">if you can manage to stay awake, then ur game...</utterance>
<utterance turn="500" who="Mindy">2. Should we improve the requirements to do Rendering and Sound on the fly? If not we can do have it prepackaged??</utterance>
<utterance turn="501" who="riz">ya i don't get that question</utterance>
<utterance turn="502" who="Aaron K">hunh?</utterance>
<utterance turn="503" who="Charles">that last question...</utterance>

<utterance turn="505" who="riz">rendering is always done on fly...</utterance>
<utterance turn="506" who="Charles">sounds like a french person wrote it..</utterance>

<utterance turn="508" who="Charles">and i know i didn't</utterance>
<utterance turn="509" who="mcknightp">I'm sorry I don't understand the question?</utterance>
<utterance turn="510" who="ScottReynen">Thanh is on stage... shhhh</utterance>
<utterance turn="511" who="Thanh Nguyen">Should we dropn the 16mb ram and 50hhz requirement</utterance>
<utterance turn="512" who="Thanh Nguyen">so we can do more 3d rendering?</utterance>
<utterance turn="513" who="Thanh Nguyen">and more animation</utterance>
<utterance turn="514" who="scott">seems resonalbe that the computer would be faster then that</utterance>
<utterance turn="515" who="mcknightp">sure</utterance>
<utterance turn="516" who="Ben">but not a lot faster... some schools a re broke</utterance>
<utterance turn="517" who="Thanh Nguyen">howabout 200mhz with 64mb of ram</utterance>
<utterance turn="518" who="Chris">So you will consider using Google Earth maps for the cities if we drop the 16 meg reqirement?</utterance>
<utterance turn="519" who="scott">500mhz might be the low end</utterance>
<utterance turn="520" who="riz">64 mb?</utterance>
<utterance turn="521" who="Jeff">if i remember correctly, they came up with the min reqs from warcraft.....the graphics aren't all that bad in warcraft</utterance>
<utterance turn="522" who="ScottReynen">...</utterance>
<utterance turn="523" who="ScottReynen">when was the last time you played?</utterance>
<utterance turn="524" who="horelj">warcraft 2</utterance>

<utterance turn="527" who="Charles">... yes me lord</utterance>
<utterance turn="528" who="ScottReynen">2 is better</utterance>

<utterance turn="534" who="riz">i was referring to than's comment</utterance>
<utterance turn="535" who="hainesj">I think 200mhz and 64mb will be fine</utterance>
<utterance turn="536" who="horelj">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="537" who="Ben">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="538" who="Mindy">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="539" who="scott">i think we could raise the minimum to 500mhz 128 meg ram</utterance>
<utterance turn="540" who="riz">you are being counterproductive as usual</utterance>
<utterance turn="541" who="mcknightp">agreed</utterance>
<utterance turn="542" who="Chris">sounds good.... as long as we see a definate improvement in the graphics</utterance>
<utterance turn="543" who="Thanh Nguyen">cool, so 500 mhz and 128 meg ram then</utterance>
<utterance turn="544" who="ScottReynen">right</utterance>
<utterance turn="545" who="Ben">good call chris</utterance>
<utterance turn="546" who="ScottReynen">the graphics</utterance>
<utterance turn="547" who="Aaron K">I'd actually suggest agains't a 500 MHz limit.  My Dad's school still has quite a few 233 MHz computers</utterance>
<utterance turn="548" who="ScottReynen">which... we will show you</utterance>
<utterance turn="549" who="Aaron K">you care?</utterance>
<utterance turn="550" who="Ben">200mhz and 64mb will be fine</utterance>

<utterance turn="565" who="ScottReynen">well</utterance>
<utterance turn="566" who="Ben">I thought you were gonna do the website for free</utterance>
<utterance turn="567" who="ScottReynen">apparently that decision wasnt clear</utterance>
<utterance turn="568" who="riz">how about find criminals who know web design and owe community service?</utterance>
<utterance turn="569" who="Chris">Yeah thats what I got...you sugguested it!</utterance>

<utterance turn="593" who="Jeff">you guys already have a website, just host the documentation there....problem solved</utterance>
<utterance turn="594" who="Chris">You need to provide documentation for the code as we dont know who will maintain it. It will be the easyest thing to throw a webpage with docs.</utterance>
<utterance turn="595" who="ScottReynen">we could easily include documentation with the software?</utterance>
