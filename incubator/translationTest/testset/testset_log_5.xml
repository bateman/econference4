<utterance turn="52" who="longleyl">And so am I, apparently.</utterance>
<utterance turn="53" who="Geoff Spears">I think that anyone using linux cannot see the messages that we are typng</utterance>
<utterance turn="54" who="neal">we all get your message so don't worry about it</utterance>
<utterance turn="55" who="andrews">we're in 2 sessions</utterance>

<utterance turn="61" who="Matthew">we are losing some people</utterance>
<utterance turn="62" who="neal">great tool</utterance>
<utterance turn="63" who="Geoff Spears">ok well any dev team that is connected do you have any q's</utterance>
<utterance turn="64" who="Ryan">Let's switch back to MSN, lol</utterance>
<utterance turn="65" who="longleyl">Well, I guess a good place to start is to ask what the client team thought of the prototype demo and if they have any concerns that came up as a result of it.</utterance>
<utterance turn="66" who="Geoff Spears">yeah</utterance>
<utterance turn="67" who="Geoff Spears">whats the viewability of the prototype</utterance>
<utterance turn="68" who="Geoff Spears">is it online that we can view it further</utterance>
<utterance turn="69" who="longleyl">As in what?</utterance>
<utterance turn="70" who="Saj">there is one computer free here if anyone is having too much problems.</utterance>
<utterance turn="71" who="whitew">Does the client have a web url so we can view the prototype our selves?</utterance>
<utterance turn="72" who="neal">http://clarkmultimedia.com/school/seng321/developer/prototype/</utterance>
<utterance turn="73" who="Geoff Spears">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="74" who="Geoff Spears">how does the prototype allow people to view the bookings that are either public or of lower priority than themselves</utterance>
<utterance turn="75" who="neal">it is not a full prototype</utterance>
<utterance turn="76" who="neal">if it were it would be "the" system</utterance>
<utterance turn="77" who="Geoff Spears">right</utterance>
<utterance turn="78" who="Geoff Spears">you are correct sir</utterance>
<utterance turn="79" who="Geoff Spears">what is the focus component that you guys are going to do for RS3.0</utterance>
<utterance turn="80" who="longleyl">In the actual system, I believe that clicking on "Booking Schedule" under a room you found would enable you to view when it's booked, and if a booking was public, you could click on it and see the specifics about it.</utterance>
<utterance turn="81" who="neal">we were thinking about the sheduling and booking functionality</utterance>
<utterance turn="82" who="Ryan">geoff, could you invite andrew</utterance>
<utterance turn="83" who="Geoff Spears">what is his username</utterance>
<utterance turn="84" who="longleyl">andrews</utterance>
<utterance turn="85" who="Geoff Spears">k</utterance>
<utterance turn="86" who="diazj">just andrew</utterance>
<utterance turn="87" who="Ryan">just "andrew</utterance>
<utterance turn="88" who="Geoff Spears">did he get the invite</utterance>
<utterance turn="89" who="Geoff Spears">?</utterance>
<utterance turn="90" who="Matthew">dont think so</utterance>
<utterance turn="91" who="Geoff Spears">dang</utterance>
<utterance turn="92" who="Ryan">not yet</utterance>
<utterance turn="93" who="whitew">How have you addressed booking multiple rooms and reoccurring bookings??</utterance>
<utterance turn="94" who="longleyl">Administrators are the only ones who can book multiple rooms at a time.</utterance>
<utterance turn="95" who="Geoff Spears">but how about reoccurring bookings</utterance>
<utterance turn="96" who="neal">same</utterance>
<utterance turn="97" who="Geoff Spears">but regalr users should be able to book for reoccuring events</utterance>
<utterance turn="98" who="neal">unless you want some permission to allow certain users thoes features</utterance>
<utterance turn="99" who="neal">or should i just be open to any user</utterance>
<utterance turn="100" who="whitew">Is that demonstrated on the prototype at all?</utterance>
<utterance turn="101" who="Matthew">no</utterance>
<utterance turn="102" who="longleyl">No.</utterance>
<utterance turn="103" who="Geoff Spears">suppose we had a regular meeting time on a friday afternoon</utterance>
<utterance turn="104" who="neal">nope, i will have to add a checkbox saying recurring</utterance>
<utterance turn="105" who="Geoff Spears">we would want to book a room for the semester or something</utterance>
<utterance turn="106" who="Ryan">Geoff, would you invite andrew again</utterance>
<utterance turn="107" who="Ryan">"andrew"</utterance>
<utterance turn="108" who="neal">what time periods do you want to be able to have recurring</utterance>
<utterance turn="109" who="neal">weekly, monthly, every so many days</utterance>
<utterance turn="110" who="Geoff Spears">whats andrews last name</utterance>
<utterance turn="111" who="longleyl">Scott.</utterance>
<utterance turn="112" who="Geoff Spears">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="113" who="Geoff Spears">is andrew in yet</utterance>
<utterance turn="114" who="Ryan">seems not</utterance>
<utterance turn="115" who="neal">so we have 27 ;minutes left i suggest we get started deciding what is going into rs 3.0</utterance>
<utterance turn="116" who="neal">is andrew even here</utterance>
<utterance turn="117" who="diazj">he is in the solaris room</utterance>
<utterance turn="118" who="Ryan">he's there</utterance>
<utterance turn="119" who="Ryan">but the econf can't be invited</utterance>
<utterance turn="120" who="Matthew">did he get the new version?</utterance>
<utterance turn="121" who="neal">i think we should just get started and fill him in later</utterance>
<utterance turn="122" who="neal">or we will not have time to finish</utterance>
<utterance turn="123" who="Matthew">there he is</utterance>
<utterance turn="124" who="diazj">good idea</utterance>
<utterance turn="125" who="Andrew">about time</utterance>
<utterance turn="126" who="Geoff Spears">well I would like to see one single click to enter into a state where you know that you are booking a room</utterance>
<utterance turn="127" who="neal">?</utterance>
<utterance turn="128" who="Saj">for the recurrence, I think most of them would be either weekly or monthly. Some may be biweekly. The users should be given those options for sure.</utterance>
<utterance turn="129" who="Geoff Spears">it seems obscure to me to have to go through room search first</utterance>
<utterance turn="130" who="Matthew">like one click to see where u book or not?</utterance>
<utterance turn="131" who="Ryan">is that "My Bookings"?</utterance>
<utterance turn="132" who="Geoff Spears">maybe just a button for book room that leads through to the room searh page</utterance>
<utterance turn="133" who="Geoff Spears">so its more intuitive</utterance>
<utterance turn="134" who="neal">well say you have 10 buildings, 4 floors each, and 5 rooms a floor, that is a lot of rooms</utterance>
<utterance turn="135" who="Lucas Longley">So, like, you click "book room" and then it prompts you to either browse or search for a room?</utterance>
<utterance turn="136" who="Geoff Spears">ya</utterance>
<utterance turn="137" who="neal">can do</utterance>
<utterance turn="138" who="neal">you guys should set another scribe</utterance>
<utterance turn="139" who="Geoff Spears">but the scribe cant write a decision though</utterance>
<utterance turn="140" who="Andrew">and set an agenda</utterance>
<utterance turn="141" who="neal">why not</utterance>
<utterance turn="142" who="Lucas Longley">It apparently crashed the program to do so.</utterance>
<utterance turn="143" who="Geoff Spears">i get disconnected when a decision is made</utterance>
<utterance turn="144" who="neal">i thought that was the purpose of a scribe</utterance>
<utterance turn="145" who="Andrew">whoa</utterance>
<utterance turn="146" who="Geoff Spears">andrew welcome back</utterance>
<utterance turn="147" who="Andrew">that harsh sucks</utterance>
<utterance turn="148" who="Geoff Spears">10 invites lter</utterance>
<utterance turn="149" who="neal">lucas you are repeating yourself in triplicate now</utterance>
<utterance turn="150" who="Lucas Longley">Yeah, I know.</utterance>
<utterance turn="151" who="Lucas Longley">This program needs a little work.</utterance>
<utterance turn="152" who="neal">you don't say</utterance>
<utterance turn="153" who="Geoff Spears">i agree</utterance>
<utterance turn="154" who="neal">not you too</utterance>
<utterance turn="155" who="Geoff Spears">i agree</utterance>
<utterance turn="156" who="Saj">Can we go through the issues quickly before things get worse?</utterance>
<utterance turn="157" who="Andrew">ok, so a screen thatll let you choose browsing or searching sounds reasonable</utterance>
<utterance turn="158" who="Andrew">lets work through this</utterance>
<utterance turn="159" who="Geoff Spears">yeah i was just thinking so that if your intent is to book a room then you can click book room immediately</utterance>
<utterance turn="160" who="Andrew">ill record this in word</utterance>
<utterance turn="161" who="Lucas Longley">Right, makes sense.</utterance>
<utterance turn="162" who="Geoff Spears">sounds good</utterance>
<utterance turn="163" who="neal">this conference is intended to also decide what is going into rs 3.0</utterance>
<utterance turn="164" who="Geoff Spears">are you going to do the display public events portion for the final product</utterance>
<utterance turn="165" who="Geoff Spears">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="166" who="Andrew">so if you know the room you want you can go right to it</utterance>
<utterance turn="167" who="Geoff Spears">what part of the project are you going to focus on for 3.0</utterance>
<utterance turn="168" who="neal">who can book a public event</utterance>
<utterance turn="169" who="Geoff Spears">anyone</utterance>
<utterance turn="170" who="neal">ya thats not hard</utterance>
<utterance turn="171" who="Geoff Spears">the difference is that anyone including non logged in users can view the booking</utterance>
<utterance turn="172" who="Ryan">that make sense</utterance>
<utterance turn="173" who="neal">so that would include most stuff booked by faculty</utterance>
<utterance turn="174" who="neal">it course bookings</utterance>
<utterance turn="175" who="neal">*ie</utterance>
<utterance turn="176" who="leungj">is the function for non user to view the booking include?</utterance>
<utterance turn="177" who="leungj">i mean in the prototype</utterance>
<utterance turn="178" who="Ryan">not in the prototype,</utterance>
<utterance turn="179" who="Geoff Spears">say I booked a room in the sub for a presentation I would want anyone to be able to come not just users</utterance>
<utterance turn="180" who="Geoff Spears">so an option to set the viewablilty of a boooking</utterance>
<utterance turn="181" who="Andrew">I have a question about the room booking menu: what do you want on it? Do you want just browse and search? Or did you want somthing else as well where you could do somthing more direct? I didn't understand your full intention</utterance>
<utterance turn="182" who="neal">a check box saying public or private would work fine</utterance>
<utterance turn="183" who="Geoff Spears">on the main page just a shortcut to the browse or search page that is labelled book room is what i am thinking</utterance>
<utterance turn="184" who="neal">ok</utterance>
<utterance turn="185" who="neal">so if a room is public eveyone can see what its booked for, but if its not public then what</utterance>
<utterance turn="186" who="neal">do you want authenticated users to see what its booked for</utterance>
<utterance turn="187" who="neal">your rfp didn't mention a booking name or descriptiong</utterance>
<utterance turn="188" who="Geoff Spears">no but they can only view public bookings that it</utterance>
<utterance turn="189" who="Matthew">another Question, does the public user need to get an ID and password from the admin  before they can book a room?</utterance>
<utterance turn="190" who="Geoff Spears">thats it*</utterance>
<utterance turn="191" who="neal">so making a booking public would only show that the room is booked</utterance>
<utterance turn="192" who="Geoff Spears">possibly a title too</utterance>
<utterance turn="193" who="Geoff Spears">such as "beer fest" sub # 103</utterance>
<utterance turn="194" who="neal">do you want to add a title and description to the booking</utterance>
<utterance turn="195" who="Geoff Spears">perhaps optional</utterance>
<utterance turn="196" who="neal">well i would think a title would be very usefull</utterance>
<utterance turn="197" who="leungj">a question from the prototype when you click on booking schedule, you only display schedule of a particular month, can user view next month schedule as well</utterance>
<utterance turn="198" who="Matthew">thats not a problem</utterance>
<utterance turn="199" who="">yes..its just the prototype</utterance>
<utterance turn="200" who="neal">mech 343, or beer fest</utterance>
<utterance turn="201" who="Geoff Spears">yeah titles should be included for sure</utterance>
<utterance turn="202" who="Geoff Spears">otherwise its meaningless to view bookings</utterance>
<utterance turn="203" who="Ryan">we will list the following couple of month later, not only current</utterance>
<utterance turn="204" who="neal">what about a quick option description</utterance>
<utterance turn="205" who="neal">well not meaningless it just depends what you want the system to do</utterance>
<utterance turn="206" who="neal">you are expanding from room booking to events calendar</utterance>
<utterance turn="207" who="Andrew">let's not get into symantecs</utterance>
<utterance turn="208" who="Geoff Spears">well if you have a faculty meeting and all it says is that room 103 is booked and not that its the meeting thats pretty meaningless</utterance>
<utterance turn="209" who="neal">it makes a difference with how we approach the problem</utterance>
<utterance turn="210" who="neal">an events calendar focuses more on design and less on booking functionality and vise versa</utterance>
<utterance turn="211" who="Andrew">Well, since we've already focused on functionality, lets stay focused there and just add a description</utterance>
<utterance turn="212" who="Geoff Spears">i thought that viewing public bookings and such was always a part</utterance>
<utterance turn="213" who="Geoff Spears">but i could be mistaken</utterance>
<utterance turn="214" who="neal">yes but you never specified the title or description therefore the public could just see when the room was booked and no details would be displayed</utterance>
<utterance turn="215" who="neal">which if the purpose of the system was simply to help potential bookers find a suiteable room would be sufficient</utterance>
<utterance turn="216" who="Geoff Spears">you could be right</utterance>
<utterance turn="217" who="Andrew">adding a title is easy</utterance>
<utterance turn="218" who="Andrew">next issue</utterance>
<utterance turn="219" who="Geoff Spears">but I think it woul be a good idea to include that</utterance>
<utterance turn="220" who="Geoff Spears">if it wasnt included previously</utterance>
<utterance turn="221" who="whitew">That should be the way it is, public should see room booked, but no details</utterance>
<utterance turn="222" who="leungj">that's sound good</utterance>
<utterance turn="223" who="Matthew">so should we include that?</utterance>
<utterance turn="224" who="Geoff Spears">i think so</utterance>
<utterance turn="225" who="Saj">so what was the complete decision?</utterance>
<utterance turn="226" who="neal">unless it is set to public and then the public can see everything</utterance>
<utterance turn="227" who="neal">ie a concert</utterance>
<utterance turn="228" who="Geoff Spears">ya</utterance>
<utterance turn="229" who="neal">ok done and done</utterance>
<utterance turn="230" who="Geoff Spears">if its faculty then the faculty can see it</utterance>
<utterance turn="231" who="Geoff Spears">and its info but students can only see its booked</utterance>
<utterance turn="232" who="Andrew">you mean if</utterance>
<utterance turn="233" who="neal">that doesn't make sence at all</utterance>
<utterance turn="234" who="neal">if the public can see the concert and that time, then they know its booked</utterance>
<utterance turn="235" who="whitew">which part?</utterance>
<utterance turn="236" who="whitew">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="237" who="Geoff Spears">if its a faculty meeting then the faculty can see the booking duration and the relevant information but students can only see that the room is  booked</utterance>
<utterance turn="238" who="neal">but then what was all that about only students seeing it</utterance>
<utterance turn="239" who="Andrew">you said "unless it is set to public and then the public can see everything"</utterance>
<utterance turn="240" who="neal">but all that info would show up on the calendar</utterance>
<utterance turn="241" who="Geoff Spears">i accidentally hit enter mid message</utterance>
<utterance turn="242" who="Andrew">it should be "if it is set to public and then the public can see everything"</utterance>
<utterance turn="243" who="neal">because if a concert is going from 9:00pm to 1:am then its obvious that its booked</utterance>
<utterance turn="244" who="neal">and what time it's booked form</utterance>
<utterance turn="245" who="Matthew">what other student? can they see the detail of other student booking a room?</utterance>
<utterance turn="246" who="Geoff Spears">but in theory you would want people to attend the concert so telling them its a concert during that time would be very usesful</utterance>
<utterance turn="247" who="neal">?</utterance>
<utterance turn="248" who="Matthew">^ about</utterance>
<utterance turn="249" who="Lucas Longley">Shouldn't we skip to RS 3.0?  We were going to talk about it but got sidetracked, and there are only five minutes.</utterance>
<utterance turn="250" who="gravesr">I suppose one way to say it is that a user from the same class of user can see the details of the booking, but all other user classes can only see the general stuff</utterance>
<utterance turn="251" who="Andrew">I think we have this sorted on our end</utterance>
<utterance turn="252" who="Ryan">public=show booked status with event detail; private=show booked status only? is that correct</utterance>
<utterance turn="253" who="Andrew">Bookings, private or public for viewing, checkbox? Public bookings, optional title
 
Private, only groups can see details, or bookers. Ie faculty can see all faculty booked items, students can only see items that they book themselves.</utterance>
<utterance turn="254" who="neal">ok 4 minutes left</utterance>
<utterance turn="255" who="whitew">Well it looks like maybe one decision was made.</utterance>
<utterance turn="256" who="Andrew">can we move on?</utterance>
<utterance turn="257" who="Lucas Longley">What happened to talking about RS 3.0?</utterance>
<utterance turn="258" who="whitew">why u  asking rs3?</utterance>
<utterance turn="259" who="Lucas Longley">I thought we were supposed to talk about that briefly.</utterance>
<utterance turn="260" who="whitew">does the dev team have any questions for client?</utterance>
<utterance turn="261" who="neal">because that is the purpose of the meeting to decide what feature to implement in rs 3.0</utterance>
<utterance turn="262" who="chaingj">man, your can type message three time at once, you are good</utterance>
<utterance turn="263" who="Lucas Longley">Yes, the software gives me the speed of three typers in one.</utterance>
<utterance turn="264" who="diazj">no, we are not supposed to tell you what is the most important feature of the system. You should decide that</utterance>
<utterance turn="265" who="whitew">what was dev teams suggestion again</utterance>
<utterance turn="266" who="neal">yes</utterance>
<utterance turn="267" who="neal">and negociate exactly what its going to be</utterance>
<utterance turn="268" who="Lucas Longley">Suggestion  for what?</utterance>
<utterance turn="269" who="neal">you have to decide that what wer are going to develop is satisfactory</utterance>
<utterance turn="270" who="Saj">"Book a room" sounds like the most important functionality to me.</utterance>
<utterance turn="271" who="Andrew">I think probably the most important part is probably making bookings</utterance>
<utterance turn="272" who="neal">i already suggested that we do room booking and calendar display</utterance>
<utterance turn="273" who="neal">because they are closely related</utterance>
<utterance turn="274" who="Geoff Spears">i think that was our intention of the system from the start</utterance>
<utterance turn="275" who="Andrew">deal</utterance>
<utterance turn="276" who="chaingj">right</utterance>
<utterance turn="277" who="Ryan">What else should we need to promote for the system</utterance>
<utterance turn="278" who="Andrew">lets shake on it</utterance>
<utterance turn="279" who="Geoff Spears">shake shake</utterance>
<utterance turn="280" who="chaingj">shake what</utterance>
<utterance turn="281" who="chaingj">d?</utterance>
<utterance turn="282" who="Andrew">i'm vigoriously shaking my laptop</utterance>
<utterance turn="283" who="whitew">me too</utterance>
<utterance turn="284" who="diazj">me too</utterance>
<utterance turn="285" who="Lucas Longley">Okay, so RS 3.0 will be on room booking and calendar display?</utterance>
<utterance turn="286" who="Andrew">i hope i didn't fuck up my hardrive</utterance>
<utterance turn="287" who="chaingj">I am shaking the computer monitor now</utterance>
