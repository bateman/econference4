104;saroyam;at anyone time there are about 5-7 thousand patients in an average sized hospital
105;rizwanp;400 right?

107;nguyenh;I say around 350
108;nguyenh;our max cap is a 400
109;chiuo;well that was the capacity
110;saroyam;i didnt know we decided that 
111;rizwanp;yeah it's in the RFP
112;chiuo;but how much coming in and out do you expect?
113;Michael Clark;My understanding is that there are about 400 patients with beds.
114;rizwanp;oh
115;nguyenh;yes
116;Michael Clark;How many would you treat on a daily basis that are walkins? 
116;Michael Clark;350?
117;corbettj;yeah we specified 400 in the RFP
118;nguyenh;we have a round 350
119;nguyenh;we have around 400 bed
120;Michael Clark;Excellent.
121;reynens;Ok guys, 400 beds
122;Michael Clark;Q2. On average, is the facility often at capacity?
123;reynens;"they want to know how many are ""treated"""
124;rizwanp;let's go with Mindy's suggestion
125;rizwanp;4000
126;saroyam;thats on an in and out basis
128;saroyam;not just an overnight thing
127;rizwanp;exactly
129;reynens;yup,
129;reynens;people with slivers included
130;nguyenh;that's mke send then, let go with Mindy sugesstion
131;corbettj;yeah 
131;corbettj;just in, see doctor, leave...'outpatients'
132;saroyam;many patients check in but not all stay for a long period of time
133;rizwanp;yeah so let's say over 24 hurs
134;rizwanp;*hrs
135;Michael Clark;Okay... 350? Or 4000?
136;saroyam;ok
137;rizwanp;is that good?
138;rizwanp;4000
139;nguyenh;4000
140;chiuo;oh ok
141;Michael Clark;Okay.
141;Michael Clark;Update the scribe. :-)
142;Michael Clark;Q2. On average, is the facility often at capacity?
143;nguyenh;I think yes
144;saroyam;i would say yes as well
145;rizwanp;ok
145;rizwanp;scribe receives a more powerful brain :P
146;Michael Clark;Ie. 50% of the time, 90% etc? Estimate is great.
147;rizwanp;scribe is all updated
148;nguyenh;100%
149;kaspara;The system will need to be able to handle 100% all of the time
150;rizwanp;no no
151;rizwanp;not 100%
152;rizwanp;yeah it will
153;rizwanp;but on averaage it isn't
154;reynens;...
155;gosselinc;...
156;rizwanp;...
157;corbettj;hehehe
158;nguyenh;...
159;reynens;They want to know how often our beds are full
160;reynens;All 400
161;rizwanp;yeah
162;saroyam;well most hospitals are full 100% of the time
163;reynens;okay
164;chiuo;I would say its often full also, they always run out of beds don't they?
165;reynens;i think we'll go with Mindy again
166;rizwanp;ok
167;Michael Clark;Okay. Agreed.
168;corbettj;100% 
169;reynens;Yes
170;Michael Clark ;Next: Q3. What is the maximum number of beds in a room any given time?
171;gosselinc;400... as we said
172;rizwanp;10
173;rizwanp;...
174;gosselinc;lol 
;;oh wait
175;corbettj;beds in a single room
176;Michael Clark;Yikes.
177;gosselinc;i can't ready
178;gosselinc;read***
179;corbettj;lol
180;gosselinc;or type
181;reynens;1 room = X beds
182;rizwanp;or think...
183;;:P
184;gosselinc;i love you 2
185;saroyam;yeah lets go with 10 at max
186;fairheadj;ok
187;Michael Clark;Okay.
188;rizwanp;ok so let's all agree with rizwan this time
189;chiuo;10 it is
190;Michael Clark;Q4. How is information maintained about open rooms and beds?
191;rizwanp;currently?
192;Michael Clark;yes
193;rizwanp;ther's a database
194;Michael Clark;okay...
195;reynens;I think we manage that with the current patient database
196;reynens;which is computerized, not paper.
197;kaspara;That is manually updated
198;rizwanp;hm.. a paper database
199;rizwanp;nice...
200;corbettj;hehehe
201;reynens;"its called a table ;)"
202;reynens;you write in it
203;rizwanp;a paper table again?
204;Michael Clark;Q4A.  Can it be scheduled or reserved, or are they all pretty much on first come first serve basis so that when one patient leaves, another gets admitted?
205;saroyam;first come first served
206;rizwanp;no scheduling facilties yet
207;rizwanp;or currently
210;nguyenh;But there should be
208;reynens;I think based on our 100% answer
211;reynens;"its ""free bed = filled bed"""
209;Michael Clark;Okay. Thanks.
212;rizwanp;ofcourse
213;Michael Clark;Q6. How long do patient records remain on the system?
214;rizwanp;foreva
215;nguyenh;there are patient that is more important that other
216;Michael Clark;Okay.
217;saroyam;if the patient has checked out for over a month then their information should be archived
220;saroyam;but still remain accessible if need be
218;corbettj;than....that would get into a 2 tier system :P
219;kaspara;Yeah.  Patient records are perminant
221;Michael Clark;Q7. What is the difference between equipment and supplies?
222;reynens;oh oh , let me
223;corbettj;supplies = stuff like bandages, stuff that gets used up...
224;nguyenh;supplies are comsumable
228;nguyenh;equipment is not
225;reynens;Supplies are generally things that are, yes, consumable
227;reynens;1 use
226;Michael Clark;Okay. Great.
229;gosselinc;^^^ is correct
230;rizwanp;ok supplies can be expensive
231;rizwanp;like a rare blood type
232;corbettj;that's why inventory tracking with supplies is important
233;rizwanp;it's also a research facility
234;rizwanp;so a bacteria culture
235;rizwanp;which was orderd in from china for example
236;rizwanp;or smuggled... whatever
237;saroyam;lol
238;corbettj;lol
239;Michael Clark;Q7A.  Are all supplies ordered, or some created in house like blood donations?
240;reynens;yeah, blood, pharmaceuticals, needles = supplies
241;nguyenh;yes
242;gosselinc;both
243;Michael Clark;Thank you.
244;Michael Clark;That is all for Business and Administration. On to the next section.
245;chiuo;waiit
246;reynens;yup
247;chiuo;don't switch
248;reynens;whoops
249;chiuo;it clears the screen
250;Michael Clark;Any last words about business and admin.
251;rizwanp;ok
252;kaspara;nope
253;rizwanp;are the decisions being saved?
254;nguyenh;no
255;Michael Clark;I will monitor who is typing before moving on.
256;corbettj;nothing here
257;rizwanp;cuz i ain't writin this down
258;reynens;its called SCRIBE Riz
259;Michael Clark;They remain on the right I believe.
260;reynens;there's one here
261;rizwanp;bah
262;rizwanp;who is reyens?
263;rizwanp;meet me in the parking lot
264;reynens;you will never know
265;rizwanp;or the bus stop
266;chiuo;ok, anything wrong with the decisions place currently?
267;reynens;nope
268;gosselinc;it's good
269;rizwanp;i am ok
270;reynens;everything looks gravy
271;chiuo;alrite i'm good then
272;Michael Clark;Okay, lets keep moving on. :-)
273;corbettj;think reyerns is scott
274;rizwanp;thanks
275;Michael Clark;Q8. What is the function of the terminals located throughout the hospital?
276;reynens;Jeff! JUDAS!
277;rizwanp;ok shhh
278;corbettj;"lol ""meet me in the parking lot"""
279;rizwanp;it's brute
280;reynens;Terminals
281;rizwanp;terminals allow visitors to check stuff
282;rizwanp;about patients
284;rizwanp;example visiting hours, room
283;nguyenh;For visitor to find out wheree the patient is
285;Michael Clark;Termianls =  Computers located throughout the hospital
286;reynens;yes, a visitor can locate the room of a patient they're visiting
287;kaspara;Exactly
288;rizwanp;ok
289;nguyenh;for patient to see how much he/she own
290;Michael Clark;But not behind desks where a single user will be using them.
291;rizwanp;terminals ! = computers
292;rizwanp;for our purposes
293;gosselinc;Patients must give consent to be displayed on the terminals!
294;corbettj;for clarity, there arent currently terminals in our system.....something that we want implemented
305;corbettj;be like an ATM that allows you to query patient location etc.. :P
295;rizwanp;whoa whoa
296;reynens;haha
297;rizwanp;what's this about consent and dissent?
298;saroyam;like a self-help computer
299;nguyenh;maybe direction to a room
300;rizwanp;so speaking of PCs in hospital
301;nguyenh;or find a parking lot
302;rizwanp;ok let's be serious
303;reynens;we are?
304;reynens;consent was something in the rfp i thought Riz
306;rizwanp;michael
307;chiuo;you called them info booths or something in the rfp i believe
309;reynens;yes
308;rizwanp;repeat the question again clearly plz
310;rizwanp;i don't wanna scroll up
311;rizwanp;instead i'll make  a request by typing 3 lines
312;rizwanp;including that one
313;Michael Clark;So terminals are devices that you would like us to design and add to the system that allow visitors to locate patients and  get other information about the hospital. But before a patient will show up on the terminal search they will have to consent? Correct?
314;gosselinc;yes
315;saroyam;yes
316;chiuo;hospital map?
317;rizwanp;ok ok
318;Michael Clark;Okay. Map = excellent idea.
319;gosselinc;may i add something really quick?
320;kaspara;Yes
321;rizwanp;but
322;Michael Clark;Of course.
323;nguyenh;driving direction as wll
324;corbettj;yeah when a patient checks into the hospital they should be given an option to allow people to look up there info
325;reynens;yes, a patient must consent to public access (everyone else has access though, Doctors, Admin, Security)
326;Michael Clark;Yes.
327;rizwanp;driving direction to what?
328;gosselinc;ok even without consent the employees of the hospital still have access to the data
330;gosselinc;just not the general public
329;reynens;*not must, can
331;rizwanp;how about a link to google maps instead?
332;corbettj;yes
333;corbettj;hehehehe
334;reynens;Now who isn't being serious
335;rizwanp;i'm bein serious
336;rizwanp;we're on a budget here
337;reynens;Google maps is bugged
338;reynens;"moving on ;)"
339;nguyenh;may be to check email briefly
340;Michael Clark;A google map might not give an accurate floor plan... or one at all. I would suggest something else.
341;saroyam;i think a map of the hospital should be enough
342;rizwanp;do we want them to build a map software?
343;corbettj;<3 yahoo maps :P
344;rizwanp;ok someone said driving directions
345;reynens;Riz, riz, we can't give them design instructions, just requirements
346;rizwanp;so i was talkin bout that
347;saroyam;people can find their own way to the hospital
348;Michael Clark;Google Earth would give an excellent shot of the roof if that is what you're after.
349;reynens;ooooh
350;nguyenh;no, but must have a3d floor plan of all the building
351;rizwanp;that's not design instructions
352;reynens;right, on our external website**
354;corbettj;lol google earth
353;rizwanp;do we want to include driving directions?
355;rizwanp;i don't think so
356;saroyam;i dont think so either
357;saroyam;just a map of the hospital
358;rizwanp;it's too much work
359;rizwanp;yes
360;rizwanp;map is good
361;saroyam;u are here. heres how u get to that place
362;reynens;no, ... lets say an ADDRESS to the hospital is currently part of the system
363;corbettj;ppl can take a cab to the hospital if they can't find it :P
364;nguyenh;So they should be able to access the internet abit then
365;rizwanp;u think reyens?
366;chiuo;I guess general hospital information is good too?
367;Michael Clark;I was still trying to focus on these terminals which are located inside of the hospital. That said... it would be my understanding that there is no need for a map of the location of the hospital on the terminals, but perhaps floor plans would be a better idea.
368;kaspara;YES
369;nguyenh;yes
370;Michael Clark;Next!
371;Michael Clark;Q9. What are the other duties mentioned in project objectives health care staff perform that the new system should aid them with?
372;rizwanp;what line, ?
373;reynens;i think i know it
374;reynens;its not that it aids them with the duties
375;reynens;but aids them, while they are doing other things
376;saroyam;i think that meant that the self help desk will prevent distraction so that the nurses etc can do other work like handing out meds
377;nguyenh;such as operations, cleaning ...
378;Michael Clark;Okay. Disregard question.
379;rizwanp;ok
380;Michael Clark;Thanks for the clarification.
381;nguyenh;the system doesn't need to assist that
382;Michael Clark;Q10. What information will each employee use to login to the system? Is a key card a consideration?
383;corbettj;yeah....should automate some of their tasks to free them to do other things
384;rizwanp;sure
385;gosselinc;finger id!
386;rizwanp;retina scan
387;corbettj;biometrics hehehe
388;nguyenh;sure
389;rizwanp;maybe DNA extraction and verifications
390;reynens;plas-ma!
391;saroyam;user name and password maybe
392;rizwanp;bah
393;nguyenh;I think we are using the key card for door access
396;nguyenh;so we should stick with it
394;rizwanp;ur old fashioned
395;saroyam;:p
397;saroyam;k
398;reynens;hold up i have a connected question
399;gosselinc;i say key card
400;Michael Clark;Are you presently using a keycard for door access?
401;rizwanp;yeah
402;nguyenh;Yes
403;rizwanp;we are
404;saroyam;yes
405;reynens;.... yes?
406;saroyam;lets go with key card
407;rizwanp;so same key card?
408;Michael Clark;Okay. Good to know.
410;reynens;sure
411;gosselinc;same keycard
409;rizwanp;but but
412;rizwanp;it should also allow password access
413;nguyenh;same
414;fairheadj;yea both
415;reynens;swipe a card, enter the password
416;nguyenh;ket card came with code
417;rizwanp;no 
418;saroyam;but the help desks dont need a password
419;reynens;then inject dna
420;fairheadj;either one
421;rizwanp;it should allow password access
422;chiuo;enter password on what?
423;Michael Clark;Our thought with a keycard is that they could use it to prevent entering a username, then require a password in addition.
424;reynens;oooh
426;reynens;i get you
425;chiuo;like a pin?
427;nguyenh;should use that code for accessing if can't find the card
428;rizwanp;yeah that's good
429;rizwanp;do it
430;reynens;swipe your card OR enter a password
433;nguyenh;that is right
434;Michael Clark;I envisioned both.
431;rizwanp;but
432;rizwanp;if a card goes bad
435;rizwanp;then waht?
436;reynens;no more buts there Riz
437;saroyam;if a card goes bad they can get it fixed
438;rizwanp;ok u and me outside rite now
439;rizwanp;yeah 
440;rizwanp;but that would take a long time
441;reynens;Staff can swipe their card, or enter an access password to get at the system.
442;fairheadj;yup
443;corbettj;sounds good
444;nguyenh;so us ethe password instead
445;chiuo;so the swipe and username/password on the same panel? is that the plan?
446;Michael Clark;Okay, so how about a keycard, and password. But if that fails they have some other username that they can use.
447;reynens;no
448;rizwanp;yes
449;rizwanp;good deal
450;saroyam;well they need their card to get into certain parts of the building anyways
451;reynens;they're screwed and must ask IT
452;kaspara;This is kind of just a design thing.
453;saroyam;they need their key card for everything not just the system
454;Michael Clark;Good point.
455;rizwanp;ok
456;rizwanp;everything?
457;kaspara;Our requirment is just a security sytem
458;Michael Clark;So keycard and password for system access.
459;nguyenh;yep
460;corbettj;that's fine
461;saroyam;yeah like getting into the medicine cabinets and stuff
462;reynens;good point kaspara
463;Michael Clark;Okay, we will consider options.
464;corbettj;lol
466;rizwanp;ok so somebody put the decision up so i know
467;rizwanp;what we decided jus now
465;Michael Clark;Q11. How will web users be authorized to access patient information on the hospital website?
468;Michael Clark;Or will there be no infromation they can access.
469;nguyenh;patient should get their invoce
470;nguyenh;precriptions
471;reynens;ok ok
473;Michael Clark;What's a preciption?
474;reynens;the website has the SAME information as the Terminals
475;rizwanp;what invoice?
472;corbettj;go to the site, search for the person your
476;corbettj;*you're looking for....their info comes up
477;reynens;but, does it have more?
478;nguyenh;for the money they own the hospital
479;rizwanp;wait
480;Michael Clark;Okay. So there is no information that a family member should be able to access about a patient that the whole words cannot access.
481;rizwanp;inwe want ppl to access the patients while they are in the hospital
483;rizwanp;not after...
482;nguyenh;if they have the patient access code
484;nguyenh;family member should be able to access
485;rizwanp;yeah
486;saroyam;they dont need to know what type of meds the patents are on
487;reynens;so all patients will get a username and password?
488;saroyam;just what room number and floor they are on 
489;rizwanp;no
490;Michael Clark;First I ask what they will need to provide to get access... then I'll ask what they have access to.
491;saroyam;no
492;nguyenh;they have acccess card as well
494;nguyenh;as they are now
493;corbettj;the public can't access patient medical records etc....outside access is limited to visitation type info
500;corbettj;that should be available to anyone that wants to visit
495;rizwanp;exactly
496;reynens;yeah
497;rizwanp;it's the kind of info help desk would provide
498;reynens;i'm gonna restate again
499;Michael Clark;okay. is that the decision.
501;rizwanp;yes
502;saroyam;sure
503;reynens;The information that the TERMINALS provide, floor and room and name
505;reynens;will be on the WEBsite
504;rizwanp;so it should be up to us what info we wanna put on there
506;chiuo;Visiting info is final?
507;rizwanp;yeah
508;rizwanp;reyens has a good point
509;saroyam;yeah
510;rizwanp;i totally forgot
511;rizwanp;it has to be accessible from web
512;Michael Clark;Okay. So for the record terminals info is also accessible on website...perhaps with a location map.
513;rizwanp;sure
514;kaspara;Yes
515;Michael Clark;Done.
517;reynens;Yes, the main website should have a map to the hospital :P
516;Michael Clark;Q12. What is an expected volume of visitors on a daily basis that will potentially be interacting with the new system instead of talking to the person at the information desk?
518;gosselinc;thousands
520;nguyenh;arounbd 50$
519;rizwanp;let's say on average a patient has 5 relatives
521;rizwanp;that care about him
522;rizwanp;or her
523;nguyenh;50%
524;rizwanp;50% what?
525;gosselinc;?
526;kaspara;I'mm uhhhhhh lost
527;saroyam;let try and type one sentence on the same line
528;rizwanp;ur still here?
529;Michael Clark;We are looking for a number as to the number of users the terminals and website need to support.
530;reynens;we already decided how many people go into the hospital and Thanh is saying 50%
531;nguyenh;50% of the visiotr will use the info booth rather than the helpddesk
532;rizwanp;why?
533;Michael Clark;Ok.
534;reynens;so 2000 a day?
535;corbettj;ultimately everyone should be using the terminals...
536;saroyam;yeah 2000 sounds good
537;reynens;thats not final Mike
538;rizwanp;wait
539;Michael Clark;Final for RS 1.0?
540;rizwanp;2000?
541;corbettj;it will come down to how comfortable people are using them
542;reynens;no no, in the conversation
543;chiuo;2000 for web?
544;rizwanp;whoa whoa
545;reynens;oh, good question
546;chiuo;are we having web and terminal separate?
547;nguyenh;of course, but I thikn we should hope half of thenm will use the system
548;rizwanp;wtf?
552;rizwanp;yes
549;reynens;QUESTION Are you talking about VISITORS using the TERMINALS?
550;rizwanp;no
551;corbettj;ok i'll buy that
553;chiuo;terminals and the web i believe
554;reynens;I'm asking Mike
555;rizwanp;why?
556;rizwanp;ask me
557;nguyenh;only the terminal for now
558;reynens;Cause you're in the parking lot
559;reynens;okay
560;rizwanp;bus stop
561;reynens;just terminal use
562;rizwanp;but i can be there in 5 min.
563;Michael Clark;Technically that was what the question was about. The terminals in the hospital. But if the web is using the same system it would be combined amount.
563;Michael Clark; The next question was how many people do you expect to use your website per day.
564;rizwanp;depends
566;rizwanp;if it's a holiday or workday
565;nguyenh;around 20  00
567;corbettj;JUST A NOTE: check the time VS how many discussion items are left
568;reynens;so we have the number 2000 and corbettj says we would hope all 4000 in/outs (that doesnt count visitors necessarily, just patient)
569;nguyenh;20 000 =  5 * 4000
570;rizwanp;20,000?
571;Michael Clark;20000 works. Lets move on.
572;corbettj;we should hope for all, but ultimately some people won't be confortable
573;rizwanp;wtf
574;Michael Clark;Q14. We need a clear picture of how the current system tracks patient records so we can come up with a more accurate and efficient method. How are inaccuracies introduced to your current system, and what are they? What would make patient records more efficient and accessible to doctors and nurses?
575;rizwanp;ok 
576;reynens;Riz, you're IT
577;rizwanp;let me talk about inaccuracies
578;rizwanp;everyone else shut
579;rizwanp;first
580;rizwanp;database is updated manually, as in info is typed in
581;rizwanp;so typos
582;rizwanp;ok
583;rizwanp;u can go now
584;Michael Clark;What in the new system would you like entered automatically to remove this person typing?
585;rizwanp;tracking
586;rizwanp;i thought that was in the RFP
587;reynens;synergy
588;nguyenh;I though you ask to remove Riz
589;Michael Clark;Okay. So equipment and supplied tracking. 
589;Michael Clark;What about patient records.
590;nguyenh;because we have 3 system right now
591;nguyenh;so everything should be in 1
592;nguyenh;-> less typing
593;saroyam;new patients will still have to be typed in
594;gosselinc;patient records are held in a server, we want to track patient movements
596;gosselinc;that's the tracking we're talking about
595;rizwanp;yes
597;kaspara;We want to track patient location, and have that integrated with the patient records system
598;rizwanp;ofcourse
599;Michael Clark;Yes. Okay.
600;Michael Clark;Q16. Are permissions group-wide, meaning should the system treat all administrators evenly and notify all when supplies are running low, or a select few?
601;nguyenh;I thikn we should track patient location as weel
604;nguyenh;group level is good I think 
602;rizwanp;wait
603;rizwanp;so the inaccuracies thing was cleared up?
605;rizwanp;michael?
606;rizwanp;it's clear?
607;corbettj;yep...group level is fine
608;reynens;group = yes, i think
609;chiuo;what was the decision on more efficient/accessiblity?
610;Michael Clark;Yes... mostly sign-in and out of supplies and equipment cause inaccuracies... patient records will ofo course need to be intiially entered.
611;chiuo;just tracking in general?
612;reynens;an admin is an admin is an admin, and a doctor is a doctor is a doctor?
613;reynens;i think i broke something
614;rizwanp;yeah ur nose
615;rizwanp;and it was me
616;corbettj;lol
617;Michael Clark;Group level it is.
618;rizwanp;sure
619;Michael Clark;That's all for business.
620;Michael Clark;on to tracking needs.
621;rizwanp;yes ma'am
622;corbettj;nice
623;reynens;Yes?
624;gosselinc;you're lucky riz
625;rizwanp;so are u
626;Michael Clark;Q17. In terms of location tracking, what precision is required?
627;reynens;we want to know what room anything is in
628;rizwanp;i say +- 5 inches
629;nguyenh;down to room number
630;Michael Clark;Romm, exact coordinate down to 3 mm?
631;reynens;*everything
632;corbettj;just room / hall
633;kaspara;I'd say floor + room
636;nguyenh;no, just room number
634;gosselinc;room number is good enough
635;reynens;floor and room
637;rizwanp;wait
638;corbettj;yeah floor too offc
639;kaspara;offc?
640;saroyam;within the hospital premises
641;reynens;we dont need a gps marker on the exact location lat/long
642;Michael Clark;Okay. Percision for tracking is room based.
643;corbettj;ofc...of course :P
644;rizwanp;room number is enough?
645;corbettj;typo
646;Michael Clark;Q18. What type of equipment would be ideal to have location-tracking hardware attached to, and what types would remain on a sign-out basis? Is it possible that a sign-out item will also require location tracking?
647;reynens;okay
648;rizwanp;ok we need to track a freaking needle in a 1000 sq. ft room
650;rizwanp;wtf mate
651;rizwanp;let's slow down
649;reynens;first is first
652;rizwanp;nothing that interferes with freakin pacemakers
653;rizwanp;we need to track pacemakers
654;reynens;no no
655;rizwanp;ppl are stealin them off the patients
656;rizwanp;and they're dyin
657;reynens;the tracking technology
658;reynens;that is up to you, but ensure that it does not interfere with medical equipment
659;corbettj;riz you're killin me man
660;kaspara;I concur
661;rizwanp;hey
662;nguyenh;Every equipment should be track to the room number
663;saroyam;u want to know the specific type of equipment?
664;rizwanp;i din't steal ur pacemaker
665;rizwanp;so don't accuse me
666;rizwanp;ok
667;rizwanp;seriously
668;reynens;things that keep alive = working with the tracking system in place
669;rizwanp;i wanna talk about that supplies tracking precision
670;nguyenh;each time the equipment move, the database should be updated
671;Michael Clark;Is it possible that a sign-out item will also require location tracking?
672;reynens;seriously, i second the Mute Motion
673;saroyam;yes
674;kaspara;Yeap
675;fairheadj;yep
676;reynens;yes
677;Michael Clark;Okay.
678;gosselinc;:)
679;Michael Clark;Next.
680;Michael Clark;Q5. The problem description states that you are looking for a way of tracking the location of supplies, equipment and patients. Under section 4.0 of the RFP v1.0 the requirement to know the location of doctors and nurses is also stated. Do you want the location tracking of people to extend to research personnel, administration staff and security staff as well?
681;reynens;most definitely above all
682;reynens;wait, wrong question to answer
683;reynens;*scratch
684;nguyenh;Yes, that would be nice
685;corbettj;i don't think the location of doctors and nurses is supposed to be tracked
686;reynens;i thought we decided not to go with that?
688;reynens;is it still in?
687;saroyam;yeah no tracking of doctors or staff
689;reynens;ok
690;reynens;no doctors, no staff
693;reynens;they can commit crimes and we will not know
691;gosselinc;just patients
692;rizwanp;where did we say we wanna track doctors and nurses?
694;Michael Clark;Okay, the RFP said you wanted to know where they were... and that would imply  tracking...
695;nguyenh;why?
696;nguyenh;they should be track right?
697;kaspara;Doctors may be a good idea....
698;saroyam;i think that was supposed to be taken out
699;nguyenh;ok
700;rizwanp;i don't see anything like that in 4.0
701;reynens;i can't remember a date, but i remember us scratching docs off the list
702;rizwanp;can u copy and paste?
703;reynens;you broke the rfp riz
704;rizwanp;bah
705;rizwanp;seriously
706;corbettj;hehehe
707;rizwanp;i'm serious
708;Michael Clark;Section 4.0 Doctors.
709;gosselinc;..... What's section 4.0?
710;rizwanp; Must be able to access information about current patients. The information should include their location in the hospital, a record of all administered medication, a listing of any scheduled operations, a history of their previous visits to the hospital, etc.
711;rizwanp;where?
712;corbettj; Must be able to access information about current patients. The information should include their location in the hospital, a record of all administered medication, a listing of any scheduled operations, a history of their previous visits to the hospital, etc.
713;Michael Clark;Okay. So no doctor tracking... 
713;Michael Clark;or would it be desirable.
714;corbettj;that's information that they should be able to access about the patients
715;reynens;no no no
716;rizwanp;no
717;rizwanp;undesirable
718;saroyam;no
719;chiuo;ok no tracking staff
720;reynens;we want them to SEE the PATIENT location
723;reynens;not see THEIR location
721;rizwanp;yes
722;nguyenh;on staff tracking at all
724;kaspara;'thier' =  current patients
725;chiuo;ok done.
726;Michael Clark;Yes, so for the record.... no tracking of staff.
727;reynens;**update, SAVE EVERYTHING SAID HERE
728;corbettj;correct
729;Michael Clark;Q19. Similarly with the above, what types of supplies will require tracking devices on them? An estimate of how many would be helpful, and if the tracking device would need to be moved from one item to another often.
730;saroyam;blood packs
731;saroyam;donor items
732;reynens;needles = no
733;nguyenh;There should be no tracking location for supply
734;nguyenh;just the room number
735;nguyenh;I mean no online location tracking
736;rizwanp;ok we can't decide right now
737;Michael Clark;Okay. So once they reach the warehouse it is up to staff to enter the room number where they are headed.
738;rizwanp;but we can let u know
739;kaspara;Supplies need to be tracked in the incoming warehouse too
740;corbettj;it would be nice if you could just track when a consumable item is removed from it's respective storage area....then you would know that it was in the process of being used up so you could replace it
741;Michael Clark;Yes, a isle and shelf number for the warehouse or something similar.
742;nguyenh;something like that
743;reynens;think in terms of programming
745;reynens;something is removed from the stack, it is known
744;gosselinc;4:20 pm
746;corbettj;what are you saying charles?
747;corbettj;:P
748;gosselinc;just saying
749;Michael Clark;Okay...so up to the person removing it then.
750;reynens;chuck, simmer down now
751;gosselinc;lab is close to being done
752;reynens;no no
755;reynens;something should auto-track the numbers
753;rizwanp;so?
754;gosselinc;just saying
756;Michael Clark;Lets move onto security.
757;reynens;:P
758;rizwanp;we got almost 3 hours till LAN party
759;kaspara;Moving on is good
760;reynens;auto!
761;reynens;LAN!
762;Michael Clark;Q23. How are restricted areas currently protected?
766;Michael Clark;Keycard access only?
763;kaspara;dogs
764;reynens;rabid ones
765;rizwanp;wow
767;nguyenh;key card
768;corbettj;by security card
769;rizwanp;the first thing u say and it's dogs
770;rizwanp;u retard
771;Michael Clark;Q24. Is there a concern for staff and/or patients removing the tracking devices? Is additional security required in attaching tracking devices to equipment?
772;fairheadj;keycard access
773;reynens;yes, Key cards
774;saroyam;key cards
775;nguyenh;not, staffs are good people
776;Michael Clark;Q26. What sort of control (if any) is required to ensure that all items are signed-out properly to keep the inventory in the system accurate? For example, is there a storeroom a couple of employees manage, or will an automated vending-machine need to interface with the system?
777;rizwanp;wait wait
778;reynens;"Riz, ""dogs"" is better than what you've said"
779;corbettj;no concern about staff removing
780;rizwanp;i dunno about JIM
781;rizwanp;he's kinda shady
782;rizwanp;so staff are not trustable
783;nguyenh;they should be trust
784;reynens;Okay
785;Michael Clark;Okay... 
785;Michael Clark;any concerns about equipment left with patients.... the large stuff is no worry. Hard to get it by security.
786;reynens;if a supply is low, the supplies people are notified by the system (admin too i think
788;reynens;i'm pretty sure that's in the rfp, i thought
787;nguyenh;everythng should as automated as possible
789;reynens;yeah,
;reynens;" if there's something where you say ""do you want someone to do this or a machine"""
790;reynens;put in the machine
791;Michael Clark;Yes, admins will be notified....
792;reynens;Supplies will be notified too
793;reynens;Dept
794;reynens;...
795;Michael Clark;Okay. Perfect.
796;Michael Clark;All clear?
797;reynens;i feel shunned?
798;rizwanp;yes
799;reynens;sure
800;corbettj;yes
801;saroyam;ok
802;rizwanp;all clear
803;nguyenh;ye
804;Michael Clark;Next section here we come.
805;rizwanp;there's more?
806;rizwanp;u got too much time on ur hands
807;reynens;technical
808;reynens;that's on you peoples
809;Michael Clark;Q27. Given the constraints of an up-to-date system and zero downtime allowed, the system requires multiple levels of synchronized redundancy with one system waiting to step in when another goes down. What type of redundancy does your current system?
810;reynens;NONE
811;rizwanp;no redunduncy
812;nguyenh;ZERO
813;Michael Clark;none present, or none desired.
814;rizwanp;wait
815;rizwanp;none present
816;reynens;zero with a captial zero
817;Michael Clark;Okay.
818;corbettj;no redundant storage, but we have redundancy on power systems
819;Michael Clark;Q28. What type of backup power do you have for your network and computer systems in the case of a power outage?
820;nguyenh;not present but must be implement
821;rizwanp;desired = yes, big time
822;Michael Clark;Okay.
823;rizwanp;generator
824;saroyam;generator
825;kaspara;The hospital has a backup generator
826;reynens;we have backup power
827;corbettj;power is covered as we have other non-computer related systems that require always on power
828;rizwanp;we got horses ready to go on a whip lash
829;reynens;thats the answer
831;Michael Clark;okay. reliable I presume. :-)
830;nguyenh;but power will flip
833;nguyenh;so need independent APC
835;nguyenh;no UPC
832;Michael Clark;Q29. Is there currently any system in place for backing up the information?
834;reynens;sure
836;reynens;yes, once a year, onto tape
837;Michael Clark;What's APC?
838;rizwanp;let them decide if we need UPC or APC or BMC
839;reynens;seriously though, i dont know
840;saroyam;once a month
841;saroyam;on tape
842;nguyenh;UPC
843;reynens;UPC
844;reynens;tape storage, woot
845;Michael Clark;Okay.
;;Backup supply required on major systems as power will go off for a few seconds.
846;nguyenh;tape every night I think 
847;corbettj;Q29 = once a month on tape
848;nguyenh;That is corrent
849;corbettj;nightly then?
850;saroyam;yeah everynite
850;saroyam; and a monthly one too
851;Michael Clark;Backup = once a month on tape.
852;reynens;tape/month
853;reynens;yes
854;reynens;oh
855;reynens;tape/night/month
856;rizwanp;once a month?
857;Michael Clark;and monthly.
858;Michael Clark;oaky.
859;rizwanp;i say 24 hrs
860;nguyenh;power flip make take aroudn 10 min in some area
861;Michael Clark;Q30. Are the three IT staff presently familiar with the current system and software installed? Did they develop and setup the current system?
862;gosselinc;you say lots of things
863;reynens;you say nothing Riz
864;rizwanp;no
865;rizwanp;they're high school dropouts
866;gosselinc;"admin_ban riwanp ""cuz you talk too much"""
867;saroyam;familiar with it
