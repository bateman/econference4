6;Jared Haines;Pat, do you want to be the scribe?
7;mcknightp;I already got my pad of paper out but what else do I need to do with this program?
8;clarkn;i think the program will store the log
9;clarkn;look this a way --->
10;clarkn;yep
11;Jared Haines;yeah when you quit the program asks if you want to store the decisions and chat logs
12;mcknightp;ok cool
13;Jared Haines;hmm, any idea if the rest of group 6  is on yet?  Should I maybe re-invite them?
14;longleyl;THIS IS EXCITING
15;longleyl;welcome to hawaii
16;longleyl;I'm all alone :(
17;longleyl;i want to write in triplicate
18;longleyl;that's not fair
19;chaingj;I am in Taiwan
20;longleyl;Hello, Taiwan person.
21;chaingj;hello
22;laihok;hi guys
23;longleyl;Hello.
24;mcknightp;hello all
25;longleyl;I am straight from the hoods of suburban Honolulu.
26;longleyl;represent
27;mcknightp;Is everyone here?
28;Jared Haines;so how many people are we missing?
29;longleyl;I think Neal is still coming.
30;longleyl;I don
31;longleyl;'t know where he is.
32;longleyl;He should be in the same room I'm in, but I don't see him.
33;chaingj;clarkn is neal
34;longleyl;Yeah, I know.
35;chaingj;jchiang is jack
36;longleyl;But he's not saying anything.
37;laihok;I think I saw him in anoother room
38;longleyl;Nor is he in this room.
39;chenl;chenl is Ryan@group6
40;longleyl;Oh, really?
41;chaingj;neal is not facing computer
42;longleyl;Well, he's not typing, at least.
43;longleyl;Slacker.
44;clarkn;im here
45;longleyl;Oh, there he is.
46;mcknightp;hes reading off my screen
47;clarkn;but i think we are still waiting for someone
48;chaingj;where is andrew
49;clarkn;the list looks a little short
50;longleyl;Andrew, right.
51;laihok;whos mcknightp?
52;clarkn;don't know but he is sittting next to me
53;mcknightp;Hi Im Pat a developer from Group 1
54;longleyl;He's an interloper.
55;longleyl;He must be executed.
56;laihok;Hi..!!
57;clarkn;haha
58;chenl;who's laihok
59;longleyl;If Andrew doesn't show up by 3:40, I say we just go without him.
60;laihok;Matthew 
61;longleyl;I dunno where he is.
62;clarkn;don't know not on my list
63;laihok;ok..
64;longleyl;The teacher just told us to start without Andrew.
65;laihok;we need to start 
66;clarkn;oh now he showed up
67;longleyl;Good timing.
68;chenl;who still  not coming yet
69;clarkn;doesn't matter lets just start
70;Jared Haines;ok, let's get this thing started
71;Jared Haines;So, first we'd like to know a little more about the system.  Are you looking for some sort of web-based service, or a desktop application?
72;clarkn;a desktop application
73;longleyl;It's supposed to be a decentralized, distributed thing, nothing on a central server.
74;Jared Haines;ok
75;clarkn;the users of the system will need to connect from a large number of different locations
76;mcknightp;So web access but not a web page?
77;clarkn;exactly,
77;clarkn;we are looking for a desktop applicaitons, where the load of running the system is spread amongst the connected clients
78;laihok;yes...not a web page..its a actual program
79;chenl;the users are albe to view the cal via the webpage
80;Jared Haines;so this will be a client application which sends and receives information to and from the web server?
81;clarkn;yes
81;clarkn; but that is not where the information is stored
82;clarkn;public information will be posted to a webserver
83;chenl;all the infomation just store locally,
84;clarkn;on the various cleint machines
85;clarkn;information you are permitted to view is stored on the local client computer
86;mcknightp;So if someone is not online how can someone else invite them to a meeting?
87;clarkn;?
89;clarkn;this software is not a meeting software, it is a calendar applicaiton
88;mcknightp;FOr example
90;mcknightp;I'm offline and so is my schedule
91;mcknightp;you need to schedule me for a meeting
92;mcknightp;how do you know my schedule?
93;chenl;email notice will be sent
94;clarkn;well the informaiton will be stored on other client computers, for example if a manager puts out a meeting schedule it will be send to everyone in the meeting
96;clarkn;the computers in our organization are left running all night so uptime is not a big consideration
95;longleyl;And the person can retrieve the info when they log on, and such.
97;mcknightp;ok what about, laptops and buisness trips?
98;clarkn;well when they connect the new  events  will bo downloaded from other peers
99;laihok;pretty much the same..once you are online
100;chenl;think about the idea of bittorrent, you can download as a peer from anywhere
101;clarkn;the mechanisims for distributing the data are not all that important at this point, what we need to concentrate on is the scheduling functionality of the software
102;clarkn;information isn't just retrieved at login time, it can also be downloaded as it becomes available
103;clarkn;and affected users can give feedback on the proposed schedule
104;longleyl;Essentially, it should check both at login and periodically to see if anything has changed, and if so, get the new information.
105;longleyl;It's a continuous process.
106;clarkn;exactly
107;Jared Haines;The RFP mentioned that documents are often sent out to be read prior to a meeting.  Does the application need to distribute the documents, or will they be sent out by email?
108;laihok;you can upload the document
109;longleyl;The application will distribute them with the meeting notice, kind of like an email attachment.
110;clarkn;yes, it does need to distribute documens and no they will not be sent out by email
111;chaingj;email notice will be send
112;laihok;like an attachment 
113;chenl;just email notice
114;clarkn;for important items only
115;clarkn;the user should be able to select if they want an email sent, in general it will not be necessary as the calendar will display the updates
116;Jared Haines;ok, we should probably move on
117;Jared Haines;What kinds of user permissions will the system need?
118;chenl;either set the cal event to private or public
119;longleyl;Well, you should be able to define an arbitrary number of user permissions and give them all a variable set of abilities.
120;longleyl;I believe.
122;chenl;and depends on the group which you choose
121;clarkn;they system will need a role based permission system, where by and arbitrary number of rolls can be created and assigned to various users
123;clarkn;for example managers should be able to schedule meetings for the staff they manage
125;clarkn;or request a meeting with people from other departemnts
124;longleyl;Essentially, the system will have a various set of things people can do.
126;longleyl;And you can derive user classes from that set.
127;laihok;for example, the manger always has permission to do , update, edit, delete the schedule
128;clarkn;a mail clerk for exampel should not be able to change the time or a meeting or schedule a meeting
129;chaingj;or payroll accountant can't change time :)
130;Jared Haines;Will certain users have higher priority permissions? For example, if one manager changes a schedule could another manager override the edit, or modify a calendar entry made by another user?
131;clarkn;but the hr people can put out a schedule for all staff under thier control
132;clarkn;but for tiems like that the person scheduled can request that their schedule be changed
133;longleyl;I believe that people above someone in the hierarchy can affect people below them, but people can't affect others in the same level of the hierarchy.
134;longleyl;Unless the person explicitly gives them permission to do so.
136;chaingj;have to negociate before change~~~ 
135;clarkn;when creating a schedule the system should try to optimize the timing of a meeting to minimize existing conflitcs
137;clarkn;so a method to request different times
138;clarkn;that way staff can schedule themselves as long as they get their hours in
139;clarkn;when scheduling the system takes requests into consideration
140;mcknightp;ok 
140;mcknightp;hold up a sec please
141;mcknightp;Permissions
142;mcknightp;Do you need mutlilevel premissions for each person in the tree?
143;longleyl;"What do you mean by ""multilevel permissions""?"
144;laihok;what do you mean?
145;clarkn;yes 
145;clarkn;a manager can only modify thoes under him
146;clarkn;and he is granted his permissions by a administrator
147;mcknightp;ok 
147;mcknightp;can a manager have two or more priority levels?
148;clarkn;rolls are set up my administrators and then assigned to the staff
149;longleyl;No, being a manager sets his priority level.
150;longleyl;I'm not sure what you mean.
151;clarkn;a manager can belong to multiple roles
152;chenl;why we need multilevel, would you give some example
153;clarkn;say a manager is in charge of a group of programmers
154;clarkn;that manager can then schedule thoes programmers
155;clarkn;he may also be the team leader of another project
156;longleyl;Oh, right, that makes sense.
157;longleyl;I guess that you could organize it in a tree structure.
158;longleyl;Where everyone below someone can have something scheduled by the person above them.
159;chenl;I thought the permission is associated with each event,
160;clarkn;he can request that other people not under his controll attend a meeting put he has to request their presence and they have to accept before they can be added to the meeting
162;clarkn;they can also schedule their own events as long as they don't conflict
163;clarkn;ie, work on project A until such a time, then work on project B
161;longleyl;So in that case, the programmers would be below the person and so would the other team.
164;andrews;hey guys sorry im late
165;clarkn;"sorry we are done ;)"
166;longleyl;Haha.
167;clarkn;we have decided you are coding the entire project
168;clarkn;we had a vote and everyone agreed
169;longleyl;And all profits will go to us.
170;chaingj;yes
171;mcknightp;so does a given user have different priority levels or just one?
172;longleyl;Well, a given user will have people below him, above him, and unassociated with him.
173;clarkn;any user can belong to an arbitrary number of roles
174;chaingj;depends what kind of job he has
175;mcknightp;k
176;longleyl;He'd only be able to affect those below him, unless others give him explicit ability to do otherwise.
177;clarkn;instead of permission levels i like the idea of roles
178;clarkn;that can be assigned and expire when a task is finished
179;Jared Haines;yes, I agree the roles concept makes more sense
180;longleyl;Well, you could do roles in a tree structure, just a temporary one.
181;longleyl;It's just that it'd be hard to model relationships between employees otherwise.
182;clarkn;i think of it as being flatter
183;clarkn;you have sets of users each with their own permissions
184;clarkn;so a group leader can schedule anyone under them even if they are manageing another project
185;longleyl;"But if you have ""managers"" and ""programmers"", how do you define which managers are above which programmers?"
186;chaingj;the application should be able to create or remove the levels of permission base on role levels
187;clarkn;roles
188;longleyl;For example.
189;clarkn;if someone is assigned the role of project leader of project A then he can manage the schedules for anyone in project A
190;chenl;did we dicide to change permission to role
191;clarkn;i think so
192;longleyl;Ah, so roles would be sort of a grouping mechanism, then.
193;clarkn;exactly
194;laihok;I think this is better then what we had before
195;longleyl;So, you'd have groups of people, and you'd have different level within groups?
196;clarkn;if someone is assigned a mananement role they may be able to create new roles and assign anyone under them to that role
197;longleyl;That makes sense to me.
198;longleyl;Yeah.
199;andrews;isn't there a potential for circular logic though?
200;clarkn;but they can't escilate their own role
201;longleyl;How so?
202;longleyl;(to Andrew)
203;laihok;I think we'd better to keep the human resource department to do the annouement and things like that
204;clarkn;?
205;andrews;some people can be part of a group B that can assign tasks to A, where A can assign tasks to B?
206;clarkn;well we are going to assume well behaved users
207;clarkn;and unless you are a manager you can't create conflicting schedules
208;clarkn;so yes you can assign tasks but you can't bump existing tasks
209;longleyl;"Maybe we should call this good for now and move on; we still have four more topics to cover."
210;Jared Haines;ok, we should probably move on before we run out of time
211;andrews;i think we're getting a little caught up in the details here anyway
212;clarkn;yep
213;mcknightp;agreed
214;Jared Haines;So, are you going to need some sort of revision control system?
215;clarkn;as far as version controll goes only the version that was used is important
216;clarkn;if it didn't happen its not important
217;Jared Haines;with multiple users updating the schedule there seems to be vast potential for version conflicts
218;clarkn;no because they can't update existing items
219;clarkn;and plus managers have the final say
221;chenl;which the high priority
220;chaingj;only certain level can do so
222;chaingj;it's be coverd in previous topic
223;mcknightp;so a person witht he manager role can edit these docs and thats it?
224;clarkn;the docs will be more notices
225;clarkn;it read this before the meeting
226;clarkn;or here are the notes for the meeting
227;andrews;well, everybodys schedual gets distributed to trier machine
228;Jared Haines;ok, just clearing that up
229;andrews;so that's the schedyal that matters, right?
230;andrews;schedule
231;clarkn;Meeting Notes will be only editable but the meeting organizer. i think you mean by
232;andrews;word
233;mcknightp;my bad
234;clarkn;no worries
235;chaingj;next please...time is flying
236;Jared Haines;yep
237;clarkn;ok all there really is for this is the following
238;clarkn;rols can edit for thoes under them
239;clarkn;a user can request that the schedule be changed
240;clarkn;the role manager can then run a feature to optimize the requests
241;clarkn;and find the best schedule
242;clarkn;when teh schedule has been modified, email notice sends out to everyone related in the schedule
243;clarkn;i guess we will need various event types, tentative, firm, etc etc
244;chenl;good idea
245;clarkn;actually their calendar is updated
246;andrews;a request can get sent to a manager to change a meeting, or to HR to change the base schedule
247;clarkn;emails are only sent out when specifically requested
248;clarkn;a request can be sent to any role manager
249;andrews;whatever
250;Jared Haines;ok, I think that covers it.  
250;Jared Haines;let's move on
251;Jared Haines;Will the backups be local?
252;Jared Haines;or will they be backed up on the web server also
253;clarkn;yes, but an administrator can also request a global snapshot of the system
254;clarkn;from all online users
255;chaingj;yes
256;Jared Haines;ok
257;Jared Haines;Is there any specific calendar formats your organization uses?
258;chaingj;calendar format is complicated to describe man
259;clarkn;various depending on the information displayes
260;clarkn;d
261;clarkn;we want monthly,  weekly, and daily breakdowns
262;clarkn;plus the ability to switch between calendars
263;chenl;just make sure it's friendly and easy to read
265;laihok;ya...user friendly is the most important part
266;chaingj;friendly and easy ......
264;clarkn;it hr can post your work schedule and then during that time you have various meetings and events
267;longleyl;Wait, are you asking about format for storage or format for displaying?
268;Jared Haines;display format
269;clarkn;and we want clippy
270;longleyl;Oh, okay.
271;chaingj;hot girls pictures as backgound = friendly
272;longleyl;Also we want Clippy to get run over by a bus.
273;longleyl;Twice.
275;clarkn;yes
274;clarkn;user configurable backgrounds optional
276;chaingj;yes
277;chaingj;that's the one
278;chaingj;I only want that feature
279;chaingj;must built
280;laihok;yes...users can set their own preference
281;clarkn;so a zombie clippy
282;chenl;is that optional?
283;chaingj;no
284;chaingj;must 
285;clarkn;well its not all that important
287;clarkn;i would rather get all of the scheduling stuff in there first
286;longleyl;This sort of thing would be a feature added once the meat of the project is finished.
288;longleyl;It's not something that would doom the project without it.
289;clarkn;exactly
290;chaingj;nothing
291;chaingj;bye
292;laihok;re we done???  
293;clarkn;not that i can think of
294;longleyl;Yes, there should be an Easter Egg where a giant stack of calendars falls on Clippy.
295;mcknightp;Did I miss anything important in the notes on the side?
296;chenl;ye, we done
297;clarkn;other than the fact it must be able to connect users around the world
298;longleyl;I can't think of anything.
299;clarkn;so that it doesn't rely on a local lan
300;clarkn;but that is about it
301;clarkn;do you have any other questions
302;clarkn;jxta.org has good networking libraries for p2p
303;clarkn;but you don't have to use it
304;Jared Haines;I think that covers it for now
305;Jared Haines;anything else, Pat?
306;mcknightp;I think I'm going to ask Neil a couple of things but I think that wraps it up
307;clarkn;have you ever seen tacky macromedias personal assistant for dreamweaver
308;Jared Haines;well, thanks guys, I guess we're done
309;clarkn;yep
310;mcknightp;Thanks you all
311;chaingj;see you very much
312;clarkn;and NO clippy
313;longleyl;Or we fire you.
314;clarkn;thats right
315;chenl;no spyware as well
316;andrews;yep see you very much
317;longleyl;Viruses are okay though./
318;chaingj;no backdoor
319;mcknightp;LOL have a good weekend guys :)
320;laihok;haha..
321;clarkn;oh the system has to work on linux, mac and windows 
322;clarkn;just to make it fun for you guys
323;clarkn;but i think that is in the rfp alread
324;clarkn;y
325;Jared Haines;yep
326;andrews;"and unix 
 it has to work on thhe solaris machines"
327;clarkn;and if you are not carefull xbox as well
328;laihok;oh
329;chaingj;build prototypes for ps3
330;clarkn;i have a mac powerbook G3 running yellow dog linux, it shoudl run on that too
331;longleyl;And it has to run on a 386 with 4 MB of RAM.
332;mcknightp;Sooooo JAVA?
333;chaingj;are we over yet?
334;chenl;who care
335;longleyl;Yes, we're done.
336;clarkn;for you n4ever
337;chaingj;okay
338;Jared Haines;we're done, I stopped the conference already
339;chaingj;god loves you
340;chenl;that's the end of the story
341;chaingj;see you very much
342;clarkn;who?
343;Jared Haines;later guys
