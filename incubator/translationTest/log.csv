23;nordmanr;client;We're all present on the client team here;Other
24;Jeff Spears;dev;k lets go;Other
25;Jeff Spears;dev;After reading the RFP this is the idea we have for your project: Essentially a secure messenger clone for the client end, with file sharing and transfers capabilties. These clients are facilitated by a centralized server that stores all user info and logs the conversations and stores them in a DB. ;Complex Question
26;Jeff Spears;dev;is that pretty much it?;Complex Question
27;mcmahonp;client;Yes;Y/N Answer
28;whitew;dev;good;Acknowledgment
29;mcmahonp;client;Though we don't necessarilly need the conversations to be stored in a DB...;Complex Answer
30;hanlonc;client;We also need application sharing.  IE - letting someone else access a single window on my computer.;Complex Answer
31;Jeff Spears;dev;k ;Acknowledgment
;;dev;we have questions about that so just wanted an overview;Task
32;Jeff Spears;dev;how do we move to the next topic;Other
33;nordmanr;client;You were on it;Other
34;nordmanr;client;there;Other
35;Jeff Spears;dev;ah perfect;Other
36;Jeff Spears;dev;ok I preparde all the questions eariler;Other
37;Jeff Spears;dev;so I'll just cut and paste em;Other
38;beckd;client;great;Other
39;Jeff Spears;dev;"2.0 share source code quickly and easily with another remote employee
 
 How many users should be able to share code??
 Does sharing code men simultaneous editing??";Complex Question
40;hanlonc;client;I believe sharing code refers to the ability to copy and paste code easily.  Without it getting messy.;Complex Answer
41;stuartc;client;unless you're referring to the application sharing part;Check
42;Jeff Spears;dev;no we're just dealing with the 2.0 portion right now;Task
43;nordmanr;client;Yeah, we should be able to share a coding application between two users;Task
44;whitew;dev;refering to the first bullet of 2.0;Task
45;nordmanr;client;But in terms of sharing code, I think with respect to that we just meant copy and paste functionality;Agreement
46;Jeff Spears;dev;so passing a viewable window of the code to the other person ;Check
47;stuartc;client;exactly;Agreement
48;whitew;dev;ok;Acknowledgment
49;Jeff Spears;dev;and they can get access to it and make changes;Task
50;Jeff Spears;dev;while both people watch;Task
51;Jeff Spears;dev;not both trying to do it at the same time;Task
52;whitew;dev;one will have to allow the other to view/modify;Task
53;nordmanr;client;I think it would be sufficient just if they could send big blocks of source code to each other via a copy and paste kind of system, and then if editing is required they could use the application sharing feature...;Task
54;nordmanr;client;what do you guys think?;Check
55;hanlonc;client;I second that.;Agreement
56;mcmahonp;client;Yeah, that was what we had envisioned.;Agreement
57;beckd;client;done.;Acknowledgment
58;stuartc;client;that sounds good;Agreement
59;Jeff Spears;dev;okay ;Acknowledgment
60;whitew;dev;done;Acknowledgment
61;nordmanr;client;Make sense, Jeff?;Check
63;Jeff Spears;dev;yeah makes sense to me;Agreement
62;stuartc;client;did we want a dedicated window for this?;Complex Question
64;mcmahonp;client;All we wanted was an IM feature that wasn't length restricted and preserved indentation.;Complex Answer
65;nordmanr;client;A dedicated window could be nice, but that's more of an implementation detail;Task
66;Jeff Spears;dev;ok perfect;Acknowledgment
67;nordmanr;client;yeah;Agreement
68;Jeff Spears;dev;next q;Other
69;Jeff Spears;dev;Directory of users  basically a contact list with everyone from the company??;Y/N Question
70;mcmahonp;client;yes;Y/N Answer
71;Jeff Spears;dev;split into sections or something;Task
72;whitew;dev;stored on the central server;Task
73;sheny;client;like different dept;Complex Answer
74;stuartc;client;right;Agreement
75;Jeff Spears;dev;yeah;Agreement
76;;;exactly;
77;stuartc;client;and different offices;Task
78;Jeff Spears;dev;different offices=diff locations? right;Check
79;stuartc;client;yes;Agreement
80;Jeff Spears;dev;k;Acknowledgment
81;Jeff Spears;dev;Archive Can users view other conversations like if you missed a meeting?? Or do you need an invite to view?? ;Complex Question
82;hanlonc;client;The directory also needs to include favorites type functionality.  So that users can see a list of the users they talk to most.;Complex Answer
83;Jeff Spears;dev;yeah i envisioned that;Agreement
84;hanlonc;client;0;Y/N Answer
85;Jeff Spears;dev;ok;Acknowledgment
86;mcmahonp;client;But it would be nice if a user could choose to make a conversation public.;Task
87;stuartc;client;thats what i was thinking;Agreement
88;hanlonc;client;I agree.;Agreement
89;stuartc;client;maybe if we could set different permissions on the logs;Task
90;Jeff Spears;dev;oh ok I like that idea;Agreement
91;nordmanr;client;yeah, that sounds good;Agreement
92;hanlonc;client;The company security/privacy officer will also need to be able to read all logs.;Task
93;mcmahonp;client;yeah;Agreement
94;mcmahonp;client;Though all his access to the logs should be in turn logged.;Task
95;Jeff Spears;dev;ok;Acknowledgment
96;Jeff Spears;dev;Secure connections inter office or can users connect from home etc. ??;Y/N Question
97;whitew;dev;jeff, how bout the next question;Other
98;nordmanr;client;No, only inter office;Y/N Answer
99;stuartc;client;for security's sake;Task
100;Jeff Spears;dev;ok;Acknowledgment
101;hanlonc;client;I think users who are connected via the corporate VPN should be able to participate in conversations.;Task
102;beckd;client;VPN?;Check
103;whitew;dev;we can have secure VPN;Check
104;mcmahonp;client;Do we have a VPN...;Check
105;nordmanr;client;Would our company really have that service?;Y/N Question
106;mcmahonp;client;I don't think we do.;Y/N Answer
107;nordmanr;client;It's kind of a security risk to allow employees to take source code home with them;Task
108;Jeff Spears;dev;so no VPN?;Check
109;hanlonc;client;Most of the software companies I've worked for have implemented some form of VPN.;Complex Answer
110;nordmanr;client;Let's say that we'd like that feature but we probably wouldn't use it yet;Complex Answer
111;mcmahonp;client;"Yeah, but we're a ""secure"" company.";Disagreement
112;nordmanr;client;In the future we may need this system to support it;Task
113;Jeff Spears;dev;maybe leave the VPN for RES 2.0?;Check
114;Jeff Spears;;so set it up to be compatible with a future VPN ;
115;nordmanr;client;Yes;Agreement
116;hanlonc;client;How about anyone who is connected to our private TCP/IP network can access our the system.  For the timebeing that is only local users but in the future it could include vpn users...;Task
117;nordmanr;client;Yeah, what Chris said;Agreement
118;Jeff Spears;dev;ok sounds good;Agreement
119;nordmanr;client;next q;Other
120;stuartc;client;sounds good;Agreement
121;Jeff Spears;dev;provide intrasite connectivity if external connections are interrupted. Do you mean ability to connect with other users internally when there is no external internet connection??;Y/N Question
122;nordmanr;client;Yes, in a nutshell;Y/N Answer
123;nordmanr;client;I think we meant, with our multiple offices, if one of the sites loses connectivity, the other should still be able to communicate with itself and others;Complex Answer
124;mcmahonp;client;yes;Agreement
125;Jeff Spears;dev;if its a centralized server what if the server site loses connectivity;Y/N Question
126;;;or are you more interested in a server for each site;
127;nordmanr;client;We're interested in whatever solution will give us the functionality we need;Complex Answer
128;mcmahonp;client;yeah;Agreement
129;whitew;dev;start with one office, the R2;Other
130;beckd;client;here here!;Other
131;Jeff Spears;dev;k;Acknowledgment
132;Jeff Spears;dev;No eavesdropping do you want the log files encrypted too?? If so, how??  Saved conversations Password protected or public key, or other??;Complex Question
133;whitew;dev;I think above they stated that the conversations were not to be in db;Complex Answer
134;hanlonc;client;We need employees at one site to be able to talk to each other even if their connection to other sites is down.;Complex Answer
135;Jeff Spears;dev;maybe not necessary since the invite would be requiered;Disagreement
136;mcmahonp;client;We need the logs to be secure against intruders/hackers/rogue employees.;Complex Answer
137;Jeff Spears;dev;but how can anyone access their conversations are they going to be stored on the individual machines;Complex Question
138;hanlonc;client;We also need the software to handle network outages cleanly.  Forinstance, let's pretend beckd lost his network connection.  He should regain his scribe priveledges as soon as he regains his network connection.;Task
139;Jeff Spears;dev;i see how you could get your own but invites to others;Disagreement
140;Jeff Spears;dev;It makes a lot of duplicated space without a DB for the conversations;Disagreement
141;mcmahonp;client;No, about the db, I was just saying we weren't specifying how you would handle the logs;Task
142;nordmanr;client;Well, I don't think we mean to rule out the possiblity of the DB;Task
143;mcmahonp;client;you're free to use a db server if you want;Task
144;nordmanr;client;Yes;Agreement
145;stuartc;client;it's up to you guys how you want to implement it;Task
146;Jeff Spears;dev;i think its the most logical way;Task
147;nordmanr;client;In terms of requirements, we want the log files accessible by the authorized employee, be it a conversation they participated in or one they have been given access to;Complex Answer
148;stuartc;client;sounds about right;Agreement
149;Jeff Spears;dev;ok understood;Acknowledgment
150;Jeff Spears;dev;k sorry i skipped 3.0;Other
151;Jeff Spears;dev;Is the support staff supporting all thesoftware you use or supporting this application, or is it supporting the software that your company sells??;Y/N Question
152;nordmanr;client;No, they're supporting our workstations;Y/N Answer
154;nordmanr;client;Making sure that our employees workstations are running and the correct software is installed and all that;Task
153;whitew;dev;as tech helpers?;Y/N Question
155;nordmanr;client;yeah, exactly;Y/N Answer
156;Jeff Spears;dev;alright;Acknowledgment
157;whitew;dev;ok;Acknowledgment
158;Jeff Spears;dev;If you're running XP why not use remote assistance that's included with the OS??;Complex Question
159;nordmanr;client;Yeah, that would be fine;Complex Answer
160;;;But we'd need an interface into it via this messaging system;
161;;;Or at least, that's what we'd like;
162;hanlonc;client;Umm - maybe remote assistance isn't compatible with our WAN;Disagreement
163;nordmanr;client;why wouldn't it be?;Complex Question
164;nordmanr;client;I've used remote assistance over a WAN before;Disagreement
165;whitew;dev;security reasons again;Complex Answer
166;nordmanr;client;Well, as long as it's as secure as our instant messaging;Disagreement
167;whitew;dev;which section we on goeff?;Other
168;Jeff Spears;dev;4.0;Other
170;;;doesnt it say at the top of your screen;
171;whitew;dev;"it's off screen abit ;)";Other
169;nordmanr;client;We'd want the same constraint as we had regarding access to the messaging system;Task
172;nordmanr;client;only hosts on the private TCP/IP network should be able to use remote assistance features;Task
173;Jeff Spears;dev;then where do the securty risks come from;Complex Question
174;whitew;dev;inter office, and office to office ;Complex Answer
175;nordmanr;client;yeah, we have multiple sites;Agreement
176;hanlonc;client;Also, only authorized personal - support staff should be able to connect using remote assistance.;Task
177;Jeff Spears;dev;i would think youd' have tech support on site;Y/N Question
178;nordmanr;client;yes, that's correct;Agreement
179;hanlonc;client;Some tasks require specialised technicians from a particular site.;Task
180;Jeff Spears;dev;so then remote assistance would really only need to be done within a site;Check
181;nordmanr;client;It would probably be sufficient if only geographically local tech support staff could access the feature;Task
182;hanlonc;client;I dissagree with nordmanr.;Disagreement
183;nordmanr;client;although it would be nice if it worked inter-office;Task
184;stuartc;client;that would be nice;Agreement
185;hanlonc;client;Certain inhouse products are primarely supported from our New York office.;Task
186;nordmanr;client;Yeah, that's true;Agreement
187;Jeff Spears;dev;so then essentially it will have to work across the exact same network as the messaging;Check
188;Jeff Spears;dev;not a subset;Check
189;nordmanr;client;Right;Agreement
190;beckd;client;Time....;Other
191;whitew;dev;time?;Other
192;Jeff Spears;dev;whoops that was 5.0;Other
193;Jeff Spears;dev;407;Other
194;hanlonc;client;Good point we only have 13minutes left.;Other
205;whitew;dev;nope, thats it;Other
206;Jeff Spears;dev;ok then;Other
207;beckd;client;awesome;Other
208;Jeff Spears;dev;done deal;Other
209;beckd;client;who's saving this convo;Other
210;Jeff Spears;dev;??;Other
211;nordmanr;client;Thank you, gentlemen, we look forward to working with you;Other
212;nordmanr;client;"Anybody who wants to can save it 
 Decision 1 - I'm scribe
 Decision 2 - Main idea behind software is:
 a secure messenger clone for the client end, with file sharing and transfers capabilties. These clients are facilitated by a centralized 
 server that stores all user info and logs the conversations and stores them in a DB. 
 With application sharing capabilities
 Decision 3 - Sharing code implies the ability to paste code into without formatting looking ugly.  Should not have maximum message length and preserve indentation.
 Decision 4 - Directory of users is contact list of everyone in company sorted by department, location
 Decision 5 - For archives, they are private unless invited to view by owner, option to make public available.
 Decision 6 - For the moment, anyone connected to our private TCP/IP network can access the system.  In future releases may include off site ip's
 Decision 7 - Logfiles should be accessible by an authorized employees
 Decision 8 - Support staff is supporting our workstations exclusively
 Decision 9 - WinXP's remote assitance would be fine, as long as it is integrated into our messaging system and only hosts on private network should be able to use features.
 Decision 10 - We are willing to increase our max memory usage to 15+ Mb, but would like as little as possible.
