169;Thanh Nguyen;New question: The system will provide in-game tutorials and help. Should we include a introduction clip? 
170;riz;why do we have 2 scotts?
171;Charles;thanh.. slow down man
172;Charles;we aren't there yet
173;Jeff;lol

195;ScottReynen;raise da roof!
196;Charles;Scott needs to take ritalin
197;riz;hehe
198;Mindy;here let me take care of riz
199;Thanh Nguyen; append to the lastest question: The introduction will ask the student to click and answer some questions. This will test and help the student computer skill.
200;Charles;nice

225;riz;seems like mindy doesn't have that much power after all
226;Ben;i think all of group one is here
227;Mindy;yes
228;ScottReynen;yes
229;Jeff;wierd :S
230;ScottReynen;we could see, eveeeerything
231;riz;so shall we begin?
232;Thanh Nguyen;Data will be portable. Can we just put the data into a standard SQL data base? All SQL databases engine should be able to access the data.
233;ScottReynen;werd
234;ScottReynen;werd up g
235;mcknightp;Ya I think group 1 is here if you guys want to start
236;ScottReynen;ok pat

238;Charles;than is  on crack
239;ScottReynen;i dont know who he's talking to

243;Jeff;hallo
244;ScottReynen;whoa
245;Jeff;hi my name is jeff :P
246;Mindy;Welcome everyone to the negotiations. I am Mindy the moderator for Group 2.
247;Ben;hello
248;Aaron K;hi mindy!
249;Thanh Nguyen;Online documentation will be available for the game upon completion and delivery.  The game will also come with built in help files and tutorials for game play. -> Should we also create a website for the game. Just a place for people to find help, download the game, etc.
250;ScottReynen;I'm Scott, Sir Scott the Scribe.
251;Jeff;lol....is this thanh or some kind of question bot??
252;Mindy;sorry about that
253;Chris;Hi I am Chris
254;horelj;Hi i'm Jon
255;Charles;<<----- Charles/ Chuck Norris
256;Mindy;ok moving on to the questions
257;mcknightp;Hi all, I'm Pat
258;hainesj;<--Jared
259;Mindy;1. We are choosing to go into detail with the Game module for RS 3.0. Is this ok?
260;Ben;yup
261;hainesj;sounds good to me
262;horelj;yeah
263;mcknightp;sure sounds good
264;scott;sure
265;Ben;this is not going to take an hour
266;Jeff;yes it is
267;ScottReynen;shhh
268;Jeff;:P
269;Mindy;ok next question
270;riz;ok it's fine
271;Jeff;thanh is a question machine
272;Ben;so on to misc questions.... ?
273;riz;lets carry on
274;Jeff;BAH....can't see it again :S
275;riz;dfjfjjf
276;Mindy;"2. Can you give an approximate minimum # of game play hours required  for each grade level?  [Or can you supply the approximate number of 
 hours students will play each week?]"
277;Jeff;damn you decisions =/
278;Chris;The game module is a pretty broad description of it. Is that everythin besides the student stats?
279;riz;sorry
280;riz;my thing keeps screwing up
281;Mindy;yes
282;;everything except the database and the teacher module
283;Ben;kids play game possibly 3-10 hours a week for entire school year
284;mcknightp;wow you think that much Ben?
285;scott;"i would think 1.5-3 would be a good estimate 
"
286;Thanh Nguyen;So should we go for approx 5 hours/week?
287;Ben;if teacher has specified time for game playing.... 3hrs
288;horelj;if they're playing at home as well then 10hrs isn't that bad
289;mcknightp;true
290;Ben;if kid really likes the game he could put in extra time ... 10 hrs
291;ScottReynen;... what was that?
292;Chris;Ofcourse we have to have a minimum... say 3...and max 10....
293;Aaron K;But, if a kid plays at home then their result isn't tracked for the teacher, right?
294;riz;don't know
295;hainesj;results at home are not tracked by the teacher, no
296;Jeff;cool
297;Mindy;so 10 hours?
298;ScottReynen;10 hours = maximum?
299;Mindy;have you decided on 10 hours?
300;Aaron K;3hrs/week = minimum?
301;Ben;the max of ten hours shouldn't be enforced... kid  should be able to play 50 hrs a week if they want
302;;If the kid hates playing then maybe a minimum of 1
303;Thanh Nguyen;1-10 it is
304;;for our approximation
305;;we will not enforce time play
306;Charles;____________________
307;horelj;sounds good
308;Charles;woops
309;Mindy;3 . What is this game rated?
310;Jeff;hehehe
311;scott;G
312;mcknightp;G
313;horelj;E for everyone
314;Jeff;uh oh
315;;:S
316;ScottReynen;so no gore?
317;Thanh Nguyen;M for Mothers?
318;Jeff;brb :(
319;Ben;do you guys have suggestions for the name of the game?
320;ScottReynen;simmer down, we'll get to that
321;Mindy;actually that was my next question
322;mcknightp;lol
323;Jeff;hehehe
324;Ben;ya scott 
325;Mindy;4. As educators, do you think content should be different for  boys/girls?  Should we just shoot for something in the middle?
326;ScottReynen;oh god
327;Ben;not different... equal oportunity....   
328;scott;it should be the same for both
329;;possibly presented in different ways
330;Jeff;doh! the second i reconnect another decision goes up =/
331;riz;me 2
332;riz;i can't see anything in the decisions place either
333;Ben;i can
334;riz;maybe i dunno
335;Chris;I agree that content should be the same for all genders. You could have different gender characters though.
336;ScottReynen;ok
337;horelj;the content should be pretty much the same
338;Ben;ya
339;Mindy;ok moving onto another topic, the system
340;ScottReynen;"whoa now 
"
341;Jeff;i'm gonna try a different lab...seems the linux version is bugged :S
342;Chris;we move to the next topic :P
343;Jeff;back in a few
344;Mindy;1. Online backup will be provided by the system. How critical is this information? How far back the backup should go? Maybe one academic year?
345;hainesj;one year would be reasonable
346;Ben;online?
347;scott;one year would be enough
348;horelj;one year should be more than enough
349;Chris;Shouldnt' student records be kept for longer?
350;Ben;one year should be minimum
351;Chris;Maybe just exported or something?
352;Chris;Is everyone here?
353;Mindy;no i think we lost some people
354;mcknightp;ya the teachers need some results for marking their students
355;ScottReynen;jeff and riz are having tech difficulties
356;Aaron K;So, one year is okay, and data is just exported at the end of the year?
357;ScottReynen;they werent important anyways (they'll be back)
358;hainesj;I think as long as the data can be exported 1 year is a reasonable amount of time to maintain the data in within the system
359;scott;that would be good i think
360;Ben;can they import old information 
361;Ben;?
362;Chris;Yes that sounds like a good solution. Definately the teacher needs easy access to the students results so far in the year... and with a litlle bit more work from previous years.
363;Aaron K;If you want import functionality , we can include it again
364;Mindy;does that go into the student record on file at the school?
365;Ben;again?
366;Ben;it could
367;scott;if you cant import old data, what would be the point in saving it?
368;horelj;any information older than a year could be exported to a cd or other hard copy and stored if needed at the schools
369;ScottReynen;actually, yes, on our specification, i think you questioned why we had importing
370;ScottReynen;i'm probably wrong
371;hainesj;hmm, maybe we did
372;Ben;whatever.... keep the importing
373;ScottReynen;ok
374;Aaron K;Scott is correct
375;Aaron K;okayu
376;Mindy;has anyone reached  a decision in this or shall we come back to this question
377;Aaron K;I thought the decision was that info stays on the system for at least one year....
378;Chris;I think we all agree on a 1 year immediate access to data and ability to export the data at the end of the year... ofcourse in need import back in the system and view.
379;Ben;sounds good
380;Mindy;ok
381;ScottReynen;so what happens at the end of one year? (sorry)
382;horelj;ok
383;Mindy;2.  For data importing and exporting, Can we do only comma separated files?
384;Mindy;That way you can used either Excel, Lotus Notes, etc. to access the data.
385;Ben;yes
386;hainesj;yeah
387;mcknightp;yah
388;horelj;that works
389;Mindy;3. The system will maintain network security. Will SSL all the communication be sufficient for this requirement?
390;Charles;the guy sitting beside me is an idiot
391;scott;security is not that important
392;scott;ssl  might be overkill
393;ScottReynen;is that a consensus?
394;horelj;this isn't critical information so i can't see security being a huge deal
395;Chris;what if a kid hacks the system and changes its scores?
396;mcknightp;if a grade 2 can hack the network then he desires the grade he gave himself
397;Chris;i'd say ssl shoul be a good oprion
398;ScottReynen;grade 1 and 2?
399;scott;if he can do that more power to him
400;Ben;agreed
401;hainesj;then he gets bonus marks :D
402;horelj;yeah
403;Ben;ya security is  not important
404;ScottReynen;if a child can do that, he understands problemsolving / math plenty i figure
405;Mindy;ok
406;Chris;ok ok...ah...you are underestimating the knowledge of the future genrations (we have to take account of mutation )
407;Ben;no we dont
408;Chris;I guess ssl will be an overhead for the system so we can drop that...
409;hainesj;I'm pretty sure we didn't mention mutan super-children in the RFP
410;Mindy;4 . Data will be portable. Can we just put the data into a standard SQL data base? 
411;;All SQL databases engine should be able to access the data.
412;Ben;sure
413;scott;yah
414;mcknightp;as long as we can export it to Comma delimited file that should work
415;riz;hallo
416;Mindy;ok
417;Chris;If you would like a sugguestion one alternative to CSV is xml, and some db's like oracle can export data directly to xml....just a sugguestion.
418;Ben;booo xml
419;hainesj;we lost jon again, he needs another invite :(
420;Jeff;back :D
421;Mindy;oracle is expensive. Do you have licensing for that?
422;scott;xml = lots of overhead
423;Ben;ya do sql
424;Chris;Dude...good luck operating on that csv...
425;Mindy;k
426;riz;are we actually going to implement this stuff?
427;Ben;no
428;Charles;riz.. no talking
429;ScottReynen;god no son
430;Charles;or you might get hit by a bus
431;Charles;like this
432;ScottReynen;i thought we were rid of Riz
433;Jeff;lol
434;mcknightp;ROFL
435;ScottReynen;i wondered why you'd shut up for so long charles
436;Mindy;okkkkkk
437;ScottReynen;back to buizness
438;Mindy;Online documentation will be available for the game upon completion and delivery.  The game will also come with built in help files and tutorials for game play. 5.   Should we also create a website for the game. Just a place for people to find help, download the game, etc.
439;Ben;sure if you want a website that would be good
440;ScottReynen;silence Riz please
441;scott;yah that would be a bonus but probably not required
442;mcknightp;ya sure web site would be nice.
443;Ben;were not paying for it though
444;Mindy;and neither are we
445;Jeff;might be a good way to distribute material add-ons as well :P
446;Chris;Well we want well documented code so we can expand on the project...i'd say we take the online Docs.
447;Charles;hey mindy... you need to reinvite someone
448;Mindy;ok who
449;ScottReynen;horelj
450;Charles;look at the hand raise
451;ScottReynen;read the hands
452;ScottReynen;hey Jon...?
453;horelj;back
454;horelj;wireless cut out
455;ScottReynen;ach
456;Ben;name of game?
457;Chris;Football
458;Charles;Puff the magic dragon
459;Ben;booo
460;ScottReynen;i can't really say simmer down now, can i
461;Mindy;1.  The Maximum time from launching the game until it is playable will be 5 minutes. Should this be ok?
462;Chris;NO
463;Ben;huh?
464;horelj;should be down to 2 minutes
465;ScottReynen;what now?
466;Ben;5 min is a long ass time to load anything
467;ScottReynen;5?
468;riz;depends on the system
469;mcknightp;can we cut it down to 3?
470;Chris;Does that include booting of Windows...cuz  then its acceptable!
471;ScottReynen;true
472;Jeff;hehehe
473;ScottReynen;hold up
474;riz;on a mac 7.6, 5 min. is a blessing
475;Jeff;lol
476;Ben;how about an average of 2 with a max of 5
477;ScottReynen;you wanted 16 mb ram computer right?
478;Chris;Hahah :0
479;ScottReynen;ok
480;horelj;5 minutes will loose the kids attention
481;Chris;Yeah...they'll be well asleep before it launches
482;ScottReynen;no no
483;ScottReynen;you see
484;ScottReynen;we have awesome fun loading screens
485;riz;lose
486;ScottReynen;quiet riz
487;horelj;minigames in the load screens?
488;Chris;Haha...and nice relaxing music?
489;Charles;we do? i thought we didn't since the game was rated E
490;ScottReynen;elevator music, no mini games
491;Charles;can't be that nice
492;Ben;no wonder it is taking five min to load with all that going on aswell
493;ScottReynen;back to seriousness
494;ScottReynen;2 min average, with 5 min max?
495;riz;how about elevator music while it's loading?
496;Ben;ya
497;scott;that sound sgood to me
498;horelj;that works
499;riz;if you can manage to stay awake, then ur game...
500;Mindy;2. Should we improve the requirements to do Rendering and Sound on the fly? If not we can do have it prepackaged??
501;riz;ya i don't get that question
502;Aaron K;hunh?
503;Charles;that last question...
504;ScottReynen;whosjiggawhat?
505;riz;rendering is always done on fly...
506;Charles;sounds like a french person wrote it..
507;Mindy;go ahead thanh
508;Charles;and i know i didn't
509;mcknightp;I'm sorry I don't understand the question?
510;ScottReynen;Thanh is on stage... shhhh
511;Thanh Nguyen;Should we dropn the 16mb ram and 50hhz requirement
512;Thanh Nguyen;so we can do more 3d rendering?
513;Thanh Nguyen;and more animation
514;scott;seems resonalbe that the computer would be faster then that
515;mcknightp;sure
516;Ben;but not a lot faster... some schools a re broke
517;Thanh Nguyen;howabout 200mhz with 64mb of ram
518;Chris;So you will consider using Google Earth maps for the cities if we drop the 16 meg reqirement?
519;scott;500mhz might be the low end
520;riz;64 mb?  
521;Jeff;if i remember correctly, they came up with the min reqs from warcraft.....the graphics aren't all that bad in warcraft
522;ScottReynen;...
523;ScottReynen;when was the last time you played?
524;horelj;warcraft 2 
525;Thanh Nguyen;I think most school shoud be at the 200mhz and 64mbz ram
526;ScottReynen;oh ok
527;Charles;... yes me lord
528;ScottReynen;2 is better
529;Jeff;there ya go
530;Chris;Yeah you probably havent looked at Warcraft for a while
531;Ben;i dunno.... what do you (group 1) guys think?
532;riz;i don't know
533;ScottReynen;you're not group 1 riz
534;riz;i was referring to than's comment
535;hainesj;I think 200mhz and 64mb will be fine
536;horelj;yeah
537;Ben;ok
538;Mindy;ok
539;scott;i think we could raise the minimum to 500mhz 128 meg ram
540;riz;you are being counterproductive as usual
541;mcknightp;agreed
542;Chris;sounds good.... as long as we see a definate improvement in the graphics
543;Thanh Nguyen;cool, so 500 mhz and 128 meg ram then
544;ScottReynen;right
545;Ben;good call chris
546;ScottReynen;the graphics
547;Aaron K;I'd actually suggest agains't a 500 MHz limit.  My Dad's school still has quite a few 233 MHz computers
548;ScottReynen;which... we will show you
549;Aaron K;you care?
550;Ben;200mhz and 64mb will be fine
551;scott;ok
552;ScottReynen;200, 64
553;horelj;yeah
554;Charles;l33t h4x0R = Aaron
555;ScottReynen;soooo
556;ScottReynen;game name?
557;riz;ok one of the decisions says: No money, no website
558;ScottReynen;right
559;riz;is that for real?
560;Chris;Yeah I dont like that one!
561;ScottReynen;what was the decision?
562;riz;...
563;scott;how about no money = website
564;mcknightp;I though it was no money free website?
565;ScottReynen;well
566;Ben;I thought you were gonna do the website for free
567;ScottReynen;apparently that decision wasnt clear
568;riz;how about find criminals who know web design and owe community service?
569;Chris;Yeah thats what I got...you sugguested it!
570;ScottReynen;"i thought i saw Mindy say ""we're not paying either"""
571;Josh;yup
572;Ben;that was a joke
573;Chris;:)
574;Mindy;yeah. no freebies here
575;ScottReynen;bam!
576;Ben;booo
577;ScottReynen;emeril says so
578;riz;do you guys seriously need a website?
579;Mindy;moving on...............
580;ScottReynen;uh oh
581;Ben;you offered us  a website and we accepted ????
582;ScottReynen;they're in uproar
583;Ben;no
584;scott;at least online documentation
585;riz;ok then take out that decision
586;ScottReynen;...
587;scott;that will take 2 hours
588;scott;tops
589;riz;documentation can be included with the game
590;Ben;we don't really need it
591;ScottReynen;lets say that the teachers federation pays for it
592;riz;i dunno we don't want any more teacher strikes
593;Jeff;you guys already have a website, just host the documentation there....problem solved
594;Chris;You need to provide documentation for the code as we dont know who will maintain it. It will be the easyest thing to throw a webpage with docs.
595;ScottReynen;we could easily include documentation with the software?
596;ScottReynen;AGH
597;Charles;whoa... what happened?
598;Mindy;dont know
599;riz;mindy messed up
600;Ben;chill
601;riz;giving weapons to monkeys
602;ScottReynen;yes
603;ScottReynen;spores
604;Mindy;Anything more you wish to address from the prototype demo?
605;ScottReynen;Name of the game
606;Charles;"Game Name Suggestion: ""The incredible Adventure"",  ""Master Learner"", ""You've been schooled!"" or good old ""tron"""
607;ScottReynen;they've asked 4 times
608;Ben;ya name it

643;ScottReynen;most involve a dragon
644;Mindy;lol
645;horelj;cool
646;Jeff;=/
647;ScottReynen;but its rated E
648;Ben;dragons work
649;ScottReynen;so ... the actual plot involving said dragon... is under works
650;Ben;excellent
651;mcknightp;ok cool

661;mcknightp;Puff the magic Dragon wasn't violent
662;Charles;yes!
663;horelj;yes (a) storyline section
664;Chris;Good call.
665;ScottReynen;"no ""vanquishing"" the dragon"
666;ScottReynen; (unless you pummel him gently with your iq)
667;riz;dragons are fun once u get past that whole 3rd degree burns thing
668;Ben;"yes; stry line section"
669;ScottReynen;and the dragon comes in the NIIIIIGHT
670;ScottReynen;ok
