# eConference 4 #
A network-aware Rich Client Application created for enabling ad-hoc workgroups to collaborate.

## Problem ##
eConference is a text-conferencing tool that supports synchronous, structured communication. eConference is designed to accommodate the needs of a workshop without becoming an unconstrained, on-line chat discussion.

The tool is based on the [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org/specs/) protocol, an IETF standard for instant messaging and presence awareness. You can setup your own XMPP server installation within your company intranet, or exploit the free network of XMPP servers federation. Therefore, eConference is fully apt to support ad hoc distributed teams that need to collaborate remotely.
As of ver. 4, eConference also supports audio-based conferencing through Skype.

Ad hoc teams have been studied since 1958 and over the last decades as a factor that partially accounts for the different results obtained between laboratory studies, where randomly assembled groups of individuals are usually employed, and field studies, where established groups are utilized instead. The usual distinction made is between ad-hoc and established teams. The two factors that characterize these groups are history and duration. History refers to the length of time a group has been formed (i.e., number of prior meetings), whereas duration define the expectation or certainty of members to collaborate again in the future. Ad hoc teams have no history and are formed solely for the meeting at hand, that is, members have no experience of working together and little or no expectation that they will collaborate in the future. Thus, ad hoc teams disband as soon as the meeting at hand is over and the task assigned is completed. Conversely, in established groups team members have already worked together and intend to collaborate again in the future.


We have started to experiment the usefulness and effectiveness of our tool in the context of distributed requirements engineering (RE), as it perfectly fits to our research. First, RE is one of the most communication intensive activities of software engineering and thus distance exacerbate the challenges that stakeholders face when collocated. Second, groups of geographically dispersed stakeholders who have to meet remotely to elicit or negotiate software requirements are a perfect example of ad hoc teams.
